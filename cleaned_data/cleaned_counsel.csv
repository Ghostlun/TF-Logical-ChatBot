0,"my wife and mother are having tense disagreements in the past theyve had minor differences for example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy
however its intensified lately i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements what can i do",family conflict,mood disorders,what you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead you have been triangulated by your wife and motherthis is often seen in families its seen everywhere how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain it is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential for example i bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaintim not saying triangulation is always a bad thing sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree thats what therapists do every day sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer however in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveif you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife i heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren if your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have from your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to if you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike i am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them they will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should in worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship change the dynamics before it spirals even further
1,"im planning to have baby so i have to quit smoking  but its hard sometimes its not a physical need its mental

i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substance abuseaddiction,mood disorders,hi good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself thats a great first step its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionfor the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if im on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually ill give in and eat ityoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette thats normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought thats what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it ok i kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itbest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby
2,"i have secrets in my mind and i dont know what to do with them i dont want to tell my wife and mom because i dont want to hurt them but im not sure how long that i can keep the secret to myself

what should i do its becoming annoying and making me anxious help me out",family conflict,mood disorders,it sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now there are several things to consider before you make a decision you mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them  is it necessary for them to know this information what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves if your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel would you want to know the secrets how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthonce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not
3,i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships how can i fix my underlying issues,behavioral changesocial relationships,anxiety disorders,hi there its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive at the root of it is fear fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough all those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them the thing is controlling other people only pushes them away vicious circle right what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking you can start with this assignment write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive for example thinking something like im too pushy can be rewritten as im assertive and i go after what i want it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves if you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourselffinding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if thats not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there youve already taken the first step so keep moving forward
4,i had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time i have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety every medicine i have been on my body rejects i get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth how can i calm my self down im a wreck,anxiety,anxiety disorders,you didnt say what or how many medications youve tried certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but i havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there i would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury there are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effectsbut beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting ohm to meditate its about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head and when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus like i said it takes practice so dont give up you can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentationi hope this helps and best of luck to you
5,"i want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it
i seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship i let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling i let men emotionally abuse me and i am at their beck and call
i am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself i feel i need the security of someone being around just to survive i know what im doing wrong and i do it anyway just hoping things will change how do i stop this behavior and thought process",relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,it is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern  you seem to have some good insight into the situationthe type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self  this is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy  i recommend a book titled boundaries where you end and i begin by anne katherine  another book that might be helpful is codependent no more by melody beattie in the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship  take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own  needing another person to define you is problematic  thats too much to expect from any individualfor a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own  that means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs  it is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time  there will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs  you have to know how to meet those yourself when you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life  then you can choose to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you need them to complete you
6,i easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger,anger management,anxiety disorders,i suggest that you work on emotional awareness emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and whyemotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you dooften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsbeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others  being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodmany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions  for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness  therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger  being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear  instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways  if a man never learns to say i am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodyou can control yourself and not explode  walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out  instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you  what is the real feeling driving these outbursts  maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern it might help to keep an anger journal  write down everything that gets you upset  that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off  talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience
7,"it takes me a long time to fall asleep id estimate about two hours i often have nightmares starting with being eaten by a monster and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe

i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of  years also my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition i was under a lot of stress and life lost meaning

after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved however in the past couple months i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning how can i solve this issue",sleep improvement,anxiety disorders,first of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health thats great that you have added this in your routine have you also considered altering your diet certain foods are linked with poor sleep for example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time  on the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleepadditionally at bed time its important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions ie tv ipad phone stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energyas far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender you may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares finally yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep there are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if youd rather not join a class right away best of luck to you and i sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved zs
8,what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation,professional ethicslegal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,i will admit i am confused about this question  are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication  most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle  they know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court  of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation  not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time  if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board  every therapist is licensed in their state  there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensuremost accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly  dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad  have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this  if this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but dont try to ruin someones career unless you are sure this occurred
9,theyre calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as i do im tired of being called names what should i do,social relationships,anxiety disorders,it sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct communication is key to any relationship i would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded if after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly especially if this friendship is valuable to you however make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them on the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship not all friendships are healthy ones and it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder iti hope you are able to get this matter sorted best of luck
10,"cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters i decided not to break up the family
however now i am struggling to forget and forgive what happened i feel like i cannot trust him without trust i cannot stay in this relationship on the other hand i do not want my children to get hurt im not sure how to move forward",relationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,first of all my heart goes out to you infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome there are some things that you should consider first of all did he seem truly remorseful if you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake secondly was he forthcoming with this information how about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered if you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful he should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitationthirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience at this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the childrenkeep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief it is not a quick process that can easily be overcome what you are experiencing is  normal my best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved i know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either if you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needsplease know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing it may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles the web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding boardbest of luck to you and your family

14,the last of my emotions belong to my pets today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow if that does happen i might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says here lays my emotions rip i practically have no emotions left and i came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my familys whats wrong with me,family conflict,mood disorders,it sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about your pets  i do not know what all is going on in your family and i cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind thisi would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills  we cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us  if you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing like your pets then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress  it is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc  develop other things that you care about and are passionate aboutanother reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you dont have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones  you have to cope somehow right  developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for youi dont know if this is what it is like for you at your house but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children one is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything the other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability people need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe  both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life  please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse
15,"me and my girlfriend just broke up she said she loves me but is not in love anymore this came out of nowhere we seemed so happy together
it all started when she went to missouri to visit her family the first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed thats when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore i thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again
then she told me to come to her in missouri so thats what i did i quit my job i dropped everything said goodbye to my family in florida and drove  straight hours to be with her
once i got there everything was fine again  she apologized for everything and said she didnt mean any of it then we were good for about a week then she went back to saying she didnt love me anymore and had no feelings for me
the only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant this wasnt an accident we were trying to get pregnant so all this is hard to accept i love her so much i have never been bad to her ive treated her the best i can i wanted her to be my wife i was going to propose to her when she got back now im losing my family and my mind i dont know what to do",relationships,anxiety disorders,i am sorry to hear of these troubles  i see a few issues here  i wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled  some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsyou say you never treated her badly and i believe you  people in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on  in fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy  it takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship  expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workthere are two books that i recommend you buy and read  one is codependent no more  the other is can my relationship be savedsometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable  you cannot change her and cannot change her mind  sometimes the best thing is to let go  if it is meant to be you will end up back together again  it seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving  i suggest backing off and letting her go  maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind  if it is meant to be she will come back if not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own
16,now i have anger and trust issues how can i treat this and fix myself,domestic violenceanger managementfamily conflict,anxiety disorders,i will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this  however i highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse  somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas  that would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issuethe important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past  having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you  angry  yes at your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you  having trouble trusting  of course  the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries where you end and i begin
17,"ive never been able to talk with my parents my parents are in their sixties while i am a teenager i love both of them but not their personalities i feel that they do not take me seriously whenever i talk about a serious event in my life if my dad doesnt believe me then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesnt believe me either im a pansexual but i cant trust my own parents
ive fought depression and won however stress and anxiety are killing me i feel that my friends dont listen to me i know they have their own problems which i do my best to help with but they dont always try to help me with mine when i really need them i feel as if my childhood has been taken from me i feel as if i have no one whom i can trust",anxietyfamily conflictdepressionstresssocial relationships,anxiety disorders,hi there being  years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life i remember when i was  and how i often felt my parents werent listening to me its even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through in addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety we all have stress and anxiety in our lives if we didnt none of us would be living anxiety  stress keep us on our toes often i have to remind myself of this as well however it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga relaxation techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in  most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity i know that sounds silly but its true you would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold imagine being in the doctors office and taking deep breaths this is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed take a moment to take in at least  deep breaths and let them out slowly you will be surprised how well you feel afterwards meditation and yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety you will need a quiet place for your meditation you want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity all it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place some people use meditation music as well if you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice i would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before find an experienced yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating i would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person a letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end if they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue i hope this was helpful for you and i wish you the best
18,i have been with this guy on and off for  years at first we used to do things together and our sex life was ok then things started to change wed break up and reconnect and he cheated on me numerous times  weve also had two beautiful baby girls during this time now we argue and he says i am not affectionate at all or i dont know how to please a man when i work parttime take care of a  year old and a  month old and cook sometimes he cooks but he also spends a lot of time on the internet in addition i have  boys and he has  son i feel somewhere i have lost something its not that i dont care i truly love this guy but im just tired of being the one who is always being judged please i am in need of a christian counselor to help us because i really need to speak to someone,relationships,anxiety disorders,i dont think youve lost something i think youve found something  your breaking point and its about time your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him obviously he has his own issues but i want to address yours i agree you need to talk to someone the fact that youve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better you do you may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve  and although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children what would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way would you want your sons to treat women this way thats what youre teaching your children when they see thislike i said i agree that you should talk to someone you can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he wont even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on you i understand its not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth

22,"ive known my boyfriend for several years we were friends for a long time in  we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state i planned to move in with him in  after i finished school and he found a job however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time we decided later to make it work shortly after i found out that i was pregnant i wanted to tell him during his next visit however he never came to see me and instead asked me for money after i gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts 

soon after i experienced a miscarriage i texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care i was extremely hurt by this i still decided to move back as i had originally planned he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him during this time i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know although he says he did i hardly ever see him he never got a job which was in the original plan  

after that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together once we got back together i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in i thought he had too but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman in fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her when i confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car i dont know what to do",relationshipsdomestic violence,anxiety disorders,there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life i think youll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect

24,ive been married for  years and i have two kids during my years married my husband cheated on me twice  the second time really got to me and at my lowest i hurt him back we arent communicating as well as i would like what do i do,depressionmarriage,mood disorders,hi there thank you reaching out for help it takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help i want you to know that i am here to help you in any way that i can first and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man im going to assume there are so the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going if he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe ie family members home friend or a shelter temporarily i cannot stress this enough although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad its those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation so you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time its always better to be safe than sorry secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors this is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your childrenits unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe i would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues i hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself
25,"i have been with my husband for almost  years we got engaged a little after  years of being together i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose 
when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned i was happy but i couldnt help feeling disappointed too
i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldnt help how i was feeling
we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds  i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted
i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding what i wanted will never happen
i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset
i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just cant control it its ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it plus i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed 
why cant i move on",marriage,mood disorders,its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either however like you know the marriage is the most important thing  how many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship i assure you that there are plenty try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired focus on what you can control now perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringi would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately but after that close that chapter and move on it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change
26,what can i do to stop grieving my mothers death  when i am awake i just cry every day i dont have anyone to talk to i need help i am still cry over her  will i ever stop crying its been  years,grief and loss,mood disorders,i am sorry that you lost your mother that is a really hard thing for someone to go throughthere is really no set time for grief to be over but i agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief  i do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but i would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help  for one thing bills have to be paidthere are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order  you can go back to another stage that you previously experienced denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages at first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone  this may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually diedthen comes bargaining in which you may beg god that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss  it sounds like you are stuck in this phasefinally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move onwhen we lose someone we never forget them  we may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one  but we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes ona therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it  one suggestion i have is not to try to run from the sad feelings dont try to not feel them  embrace the feelings  let the feelings wash over you and accept them  trying not to feel something is not going to help  sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does  unpleasant feelings are not to be avoidedi am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now  you deserve to be happy and to live a full life  i am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long  i wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief

ive even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because i said i wanted to get an adult to help me could you please give me advice",family conflictchildren  adolescents,mood disorders,i think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children its called the childhelp national child abuse hotline the number is achild  it is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you wantthe call is completely free and they are open  hours a day   days a week im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation you are a very brave and an intelligent child please remember to call  if you are in immediate danger
28,my wife just last week said she wants a divorce and its all sudden i understand that marriages have their ups and downs but i dont understand why she cant tell me why she wants a divorce should i fight for my family daughter and wife,marriagerelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,chances are if you really think about it there were signs that something wasnt quite right in your marriage you may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage but whatever it was or wasnt its obviously bothering your wife i would say yes keep trying to fight for your family at least until you know what the problems are from your wifes perspective and if theyre repairable ask your wife if shes willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor just be sure youre open to hearing whats said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some thingseven if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce that doesnt mean youre divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that continue to be a part of her life and although it may be difficult if a divorce does happen try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isnt further impacted by this new family dynamic
29,i loved him more than anything he passed away on our anniversary which was also the day i was going to apply for our apartment im not handling it well i moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps,grief and loss,mood disorders,i am so sorry to hear of your boyfriends passing grief is something that can take a long time to recover from have you considered speaking with a grief counselor being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly this is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward in the mean time immerse yourself with positivity ie good friends hobbies exercise and try to schedule a time with a counselor perhaps there will be a support group you could also join oftentimes it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as yougood luck to you i hope you will find peace and comfort soon
30,i did some horrible sexual things as a kid and i regret everything can someone help me cope with myself can someone help me remember my past,traumahuman sexuality,mood disorders,im very sorry to hear this hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories however keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone i think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial it seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward in addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise i wish you the best of luck and i hope you receive the treatment that you deserve
31,i have been with a guy for  years  hes a great guy and we also have a son together the problem is that im in love with a guy that ive been talking to for about  years but ive never met him in person honestly im bored with the relationship i have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy i dont know how to tell him that what should i do,relationships,anxiety disorders,hi there wow this sounds like a sticky situation however im here to help guide you through this decision first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child its very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because its the right thing to do right well not entirely  although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run if you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating  when a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions  behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such as a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child just remember what you do your child will model secondly do not sell yourself short from love everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with however being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love  humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need  if you decide to pursue the second relationship i would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days finally i am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys  this seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your childs father or not you should ask yourself if you were in love with your childs father first off if you were you would have never sought after love  i hope this was helpful for you and i hope i was able to shed a different light on your situation take care of yourself
32,my boyfriend cant get over my promiscuous past he says he loves me  but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction he says he should have had more sex with different people i dont know how to handle this,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,i am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about  in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this  i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history  for one thing it is a good idea to be checked for stds before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other  partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do  this gets into a gray area for some people  i dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and i certainly dont want a whole lot of details  sometimes that is an image i just dont want in my head about my partner  vague details are usually enoughhowever i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past  this is a reflection on him not you  this shows insecurities on his part  you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information  the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future   if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship  you can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you  i have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity  it takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though if your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go  dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you  constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment i dont see that you have done anything wrong  if you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him  ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you  it is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be  in time the right person for you will enter your life
33,what do i do if i have been feeling like i could never be with anyone because no one would want me or i couldnt have many friends because of who i am its strange i want to be loved but id hate to be because i always lose,relationships,anxiety disorders,im sorry you are feeling uncared for im sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing however take a deep breath relax and start focusing on the positive relationships you have with others regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem i think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great deal about youi also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who you can identify with and share common interests with maybe you can attend a religious service join an interest group ie reading club sports group etc or start a group of your own most importantly you need to tap into your interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own mental and physical health from this relationships will start to immerse you may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being unloved this is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and i think with a little help you can see that you are more than deserving of a great relationship thanks for reaching out and i wish you the best of luck moving forward
34,what makes my step child an  year old boy choke my daughter a  year old girl this has been going on for  years the boy tells my daughter not to tell on him he knows its wrong we have did time out spanking taking away toys and sitting on the wall i am afraid for my daughters safety,anger managementparenting,anxiety disorders,i can see why you are alarmed that is a scary situation for a parent do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional early treatment is often the key a professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses have you addressed your concerns with the childs other parent there could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues exposure to violence sexualphysical abuse drug use stressful events in his life etc it is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated andor reduced i wouldnt hesitate to have him evaluated if he hasnt been already and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication andor therapy until then i would make sure that he is always supervised under an adults care
35,i have this weird fetish that im afraid to open up about it what should i do,intimacy,mood disorders,this is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is  i do understand that this is something that is bothering you though the first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not  if this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urgeshowever if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings  you may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of  you may find other people have the same interest as you  find a therapist that you can trust and tell them  dont hold back with your therapist  trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are  there is no need to suffer with this alone
36,my coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss saying i have mood swings they have no proof to back it up can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice,workplace relationships,anxiety disorders,i cant give you legal advice but employers can suggest you see someone if your behavior is affecting your job i believe most government agencies have an employee assistance program eap where employees can talk to a therapist about any issue not just workrelated for free up to a certain amount of sessionsim wondering though why your coworkers would tell your boss this if its not true is it possible that youre not aware of how your interactions are affecting others maybe this forced counseling can be an opportunity for some introspection on your part
37,im in a state of depression right now who can i talk to ive been sick in a lot of pain and crying dont know where to turn,depression,mood disorders,first of all if youre sick and in pain have you seen your doctor if you have a chronic illness and pain this can often lead to depression and is very common youve taken the first step to dealing with it you can talk to your doctor even if your depression isnt related to your health he or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatristif thats not really an option for you there are also helplines local or national or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk to each other if you cant find any in your area newspapers usually publish this information there are online support groups as well

39,im a  year old male and having erection problems still have the desire for a woman awfully frustrated any suggestions my doc doesnt want to discuss it,intimacy,mood disorders,hi there first off i have to commend you for reaching out it takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems believe it or not this problem is very common for men and women there are some things that you can try naturally before resulting in medication such as your eating habits and exercise i would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly how much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily  these are just a few common things to look at you would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies our bodies are like a car you have to maintenance it in order for it to continue to run if you would like to get further natural advice andor suggestions on eating healthy and exercising i would recommend you see a nutritionist a nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet as far as your doctor i would recommend looking into getting another doctor i have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything that appears to be a personal issue on their part i hope i was helpful and i wish you the best of luck

41,"ive been abused emotionally all of my life and for some reason i keep getting with men that i let emotionally abused me
how can i stop it i know the mistakes that ive made in my life im having a really hard time getting back on my feet can you help me please",relationships,anxiety disorders,i want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it  you are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  a lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way  until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solutiondont misunderstand me  the abuse is not your fault you are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed first go and buy the book boundaries where you end and i begin by anne katherine  read it  this book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it  you will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain thembe single for a while  stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own  often we get in a relationship because of a need  if you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons  the first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life  identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your owni was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife  this was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you  however she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship  obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies  the difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person  when she looked at him in our session and said to him i dont need you i want you  but not if you are going to continue to act like this  so you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes  she stuck to that too  he didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay  she had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left she was fully prepared to be single again  they actually did end up working things out in the endyou cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly  sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides  couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work  you may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you  a therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt but you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries  that means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you  someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone  if they feel they need the other person in their life these patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents  when someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know  even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people  something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome  be patient with yourself and find a good therapist  you cant change your partner  work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay  the more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become
42,i feel like i would be more comfortable as a girl even though i still like girls i think im like a girl stuck in a guy body i imagine myself as a girl too i think this more because my friends say that if i was a girl i would be a hot looking one and i dont care about having boobs or anything i just feel like the way that i do act will make more sense if i was a girl,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,i understand that gender andor sexual identity crises can be very difficult to navigate although in todays time i think we have made a lot of progress and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance from societyi am unsure how old you are  if you are a child or teenager this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life  i hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do  a lot of people unfortunately do not and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you  because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisionsi urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time  by this i mean a sex change  anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly  please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis  of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes  many people decide to dress like their gender of choice  maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could dosee if you have a local chapter of pflag in your area pflag stands for parents families and friends of lesbians and gays  they are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay but also transgendered and asexual i wish you all the best in your identity crisis  it would be very easy for you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding from those around you during this time  find a professional that can help especially if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself
43,ive have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,the best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors  this is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help  cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety  this takes a therapist trained in cbt there are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept  a lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over  this may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped  in cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in  one thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression  other people seem to be able to handle lifes ups and downs and bounce back  they do this with having positive coping skills in their life  learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you witha lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change  there are things that you can do  here is a quote for you to consider  you are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made  you will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes  another quote i like is you will find a way or you will find an excuse  dont ever say that you have no choice  everyone has a choice  you might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices  not happy in a relationship  you can leave it  hate your job  get a new one  if it matters to you you will find a way  dont sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or bettertake care of yourself  exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well  eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself  also find a meditation that works for you  there are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more  start making some positive changes in your life today  you can do it
44,"hello i have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled insecure and frustrated during her stay here in the city i know she comes from a place of love but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate negative oblivious and self consumed 

i have tried to talk to her openly about this but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful spatially aware of surroundingspeople or positive but in the end i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship 

what can i do",family conflict,mood disorders,do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does if they dont see these qualities in you then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you you can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are its her issue and she is not coming from a place of loveeven if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love the fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you
45,"i have a child with my baby mother she works i take care of our young son she says she is not cheating i have not found anything but she always putting me down telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me but then the next day after our fight she says she does im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops now me and my family dont talk shes always telling me im annoying and just belittles me nothing i do is right

she says i work you watch the baby on her days off she never cooks or cleans i have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy but says hes not any thing to her what do i do i dont want to leave",domestic violence,anxiety disorders,it sounds like you are in a tough situation you have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her is it because of the child or is it because you want the relationship to work you must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child so if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move outon the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging it seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship although your question revealed just a short bit of information i didnt read about any positives in the relationship sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you however with time and focus you can do it each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your childhowever if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her you need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you this gives her a chance to render the situation if after this there is no improvement i suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stayi also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy are there any hobbies you enjoy are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefitit is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family you need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment latelythank you for reaching out i wish you the best of luck with your relationship
46,or how to send him somewhere that can help him something like the baker act,substance abuseaddiction,mood disorders,more information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question such as your age whether you live with your dad or not and what other family members live in the household something like this alcoholism is a whole family disease  in other words family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behaviorfirst of all you cant make your dad do anything and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse  nobody can change another person  what you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him research codependency  theres a great book called codependent no more  there are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read  in short you have to stop enabling him  like i said you cannot control him but you can control yourself  this means do not buy his alcohol  do not make it easy for him to get  dont loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him  dont call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way  do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested he needs to be responsible for himself this may mean losing his job or losing his drivers license this may mean that he loses his family if he doesnt stop what you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with  it is his choice to drink but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking  a lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they dont then they are getting a divorceif you are an adult and you dont live with your dad then the best thing you can do for him is stop doing things for him  if you are a child who lives at home with him then this could be a case for child protective services in my state this is called dhs  a report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect  substance abuse in the home qualifies  of course alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation there is no problems  the problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption  does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated  is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state  are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking  this could be a reason for the authorities to step in you can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics  they are similar to the aa meetings that an alcoholic should go to but are for the family members  they can help you
47,in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs,spiritualityfamily conflict,anxiety disorders,i think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction there are many families that are united despite their differences for example a mother may be catholic and the father jewish by introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial also its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences so dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential

i get into these depressed like states whenever anyone i care about is too busy to be with me i know that i shouldnt act like that because people are genuinely busy but i feel like theyre doing it just because they dont want to be around me",social relationshipsanxietydepression,anxiety disorders,frequently when working with clients i utilize the abc model developed by albert ellis the founder of rational emotive behavior theory the theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event for instance here is an examplea action or event you need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backb behavior or response you begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or i am not important to this personc consequence you feel depressedif you look at the model b has a direct effect on c the thought is if you change your reaction to a then c will have a better consequence such asa stays the sameb this is what you change this person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or i can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availablec decreased feelings of depression  overall functioning improvesthis is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve if this model resonates with you i recommend feeling better getting better staying better by alber ellis in addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone

tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex which is a big deal once things started she had the most obviously fake orgasm ive ever encountered i was honest with her about why and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it she responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking i dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation i think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further please help",intimacy,mood disorders,you are newly married you have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication what if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another you know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  it turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments and have fun with it

somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works nothing has changed and i feel hopeless any suggestions or ideas",family conflictselfesteem,mood disorders,hello and let me say first what a great question there are so many people putting forth their  everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionfirst i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough is that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern if so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if its a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals no one will ever be  good enough for everyone every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives the question becomes what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations there is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really you youre trying to feel good enough for if you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on letting go of the rest no one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left after all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowi recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra no one can make you feel inferior without your consent   eleanor roosevelt

87,"i know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him once he believes i am being negative i cant seem to find a better way of communicating in fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating 

what advice might you offer",relationships,anxiety disorders,with any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc  begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense modethen share how you felt at the time of the event  just say when i felt kind of hurt  shocked or whatever the feeling was  period  thats all you should say  wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statementno matter what his response is stick to your same message  dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  you can even add i agree i could have misunderstood  it event i just know it made me feel uneasyhere you give him little wiggle room for a debategood luck  id love to hear how it goes
88,when i ask him who he is talking to he tells me no one but it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone i have even accused him of having a secret cell phone i ask so much i feel like i am losing it  is he trying to make me question my sanity or is he talking to himself,relationships,anxiety disorders,a rare topic  likely extremely troublesome for you i would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight feel free to email mei would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level  partners need each others trust and support no matter who is right or wrong

90,we went out had great sex and i was really liking her then one day she says we should just be friends but i cant stop thinking about her shes always on mind and i want her back,relationships,anxiety disorders,it can be really difficult when someone you care about doesnt feel the same about you the most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way  there is nothing you can do to force her to want to be in a relationship with youin the end if she just wants to be friends then shes probably not the right match for youremember every relationship ends  until that last one that doesnt  and that is how its supposed to be

93,what do i do if i have been feeling like i could never be with anyone because no one would want me or i couldnt have many friends because of who i am its strange i want to be loved but id hate to be because i always lose,relationships,anxiety disorders,as a relationship therapist i work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood how did you caregivers express or not express love towards you how did they express or not express love towards one another these early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others in his book wired for love stan tatkin psyd writes we learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone we learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us our self worth and selfesteem also develop because of other people  this could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it you may have to interview a few to find the right fit thats ok maybe youd even want to read that book i linked above  noticing this pattern is huge its where transformation begins and now that you have be kind with yourself it begins there too

103,about  months ago my ex left without fully explaining why for me it seemed out of the blue i dont miss her as much as i used to but i just dont trust people anymore not even my friends who i have known since my childhood not even my family im so terrified of being judged or dismissed instead of acting like someone else or putting on a mask of a personality ive just shut down i havent felt that sense of comfort and happiness with myself since everything fell apart im scared to because i dont want it to be taken away from me again i feel like ever lesson i learn only last a day i just dont know what to do im working at a place i know i should enjoy im keeping up with my creative passions working out eating healthy etc im doing everything the books say i should do but i dont feel any different i just dont know what to do,selfesteemrelationships,mood disorders,sounds like you need closure im sure your doing your best to overcome this feeling but seem to be struggling with your own happiness trust god no one else give this some time and dont close yourself off to the world or the people who love you be open hearted and minded and know that no matter what reason your ex walked out of your life she missed out on how great of a person you truly are and may have had personal issues of her own
104,then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me this rollercoaster is crazy,relationships,anxiety disorders,your partners obviously very confused when it comes to love sometimes people shy away from good and positive relationships and companionship because their afraid they know that its something worth holding on to but most feel they cant handle it and cant meet up to their partners expectations your partner loves you but must have fear that keeps standing in his way it could also mean their afraid of getting hurt or disapointed in the long run  give your partner comfort and reassurance that they can come to you to confide in you about anything that may be bothering them
105,sometimes  times a night,sleep improvement,anxiety disorders,"thats a difficult question to answer dreaming is a normal and healthy part of the sleep cycle the current thought is that we all generally
experience roughly the same number of dreams  the difference often is just
whether we remember the dreams or notan increase in the number or frequency of distressing dreams
or nightmares can be a symptom of stress anxiety or ptsd  if the dreams are disturbing to you talking to a local
counselor could help if the dreams themselves
are not troubling you may just be remembering them more than most people do"

107,i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,selfesteem,mood disorders,"i can relate when things are going badly i feel like my life has
always been and will always be that way but i also do this when things are
going well that is i forget how good things can turn bad personally to
avoid this emotional rollercoaster i try and heed the famous advice by author
and feminist rita mae brown one of the keys to happiness is a bad
memoryso maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a
strength it sounds a lot like living in the moment to me and while its hard
to manage my past and my future the moment seems like a small enough piece of
temporal real estate to sort out so thats the what of my answer the how
goes like this choose one from column a two from column b and three from
column c in the following chart then try doing them for as long as you can
then see what happensa                                            b                                                  cgratitude                                forgiveness                                 appreciationexpectations                           meditation                                    exercisebitterness                               distraction                                    volunteering

think and believe are out of your control or that your values were imposed on
you or that nothing good will ever happen again then we will have to
respectfully disagree youve ask a very deep and insightful question proving
that your hope has gotten you this far hang onto that hope because im an
example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my lifeinstead of convincing
yourself that youre okay when youre not how about calling it accepting
yourself as okay just the way you are without judging your okayness you
probably have high standards perfectionism and thats a thing to talk with a
counselor about the opposite of perfect is not horrible its called good
enoughblocking out the bad things and
forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping all the other mammals do it
except when it comes to lifethreatening bad things so why shouldnt we this
might be called optimism
feeling alone and uncared for
is a worse feeling than being despised this is good this means i suppose
that you dont despise yourself as much as you just dont care for you because
we can often project our own selfbeliefs onto others this is an abstract
concept that will take some time to get used to but i have a suspicion that
with just a little more selfcare and a little more caring for others you
might be better off very soon"

is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way this is not a joke i am trying to understand",family conflict,mood disorders,hi this sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out my first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  as far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries be clear about the expectations of your home also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue i hope this helps you your family members and the pets

156,i am going through a very hard time and im so depressed my parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening i want to lull myself,relationship dissolution depression,mood disorders,consider yourself quite normal for feeling overwhelmed and depressed about your parents divorce   this is the most natural way to feel at this timedepending on how old you are and whether you live under their roof  are dependent on their support and are either part of the decision or not of with whom and where you will live start considering these pointshow did you find out about the upcoming divorceare either of your parents reluctant to answer your questions or is it clear that neither of them want to talk about anything with youwhatever your fears and questions about your own future these are all real  it is necessary for you to know about your basic futureif you are living on your own and the main problem is your inner adjustment that your family structure is completely changing then probably a good therapist would be a great help to you now to clarify these tensionssending lots of good wishes for an easy resolution to your new path
157,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxietytrauma,anxiety disorders,its not unusual for traumatic experiences that happened when we were younger to stay with us when we get older  traumatic experiences can become embedded in our bodies as well as in our emotions  if the issue doesnt get a chance to get resolved within then external action doesnt necessarily take care of the problem  seek out a qualified trauma therapist so you can start to deal with the issues youre grappling with
158,my toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training he almost throws up every time he sees his poop he gags and will not go on the toilet we have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it when he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee he holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper i dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him how can i help him get over this fear and passed the stress,parenting,anxiety disorders,your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained you dont say how old he is so im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so i suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again in general teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively
159,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxietytrauma,anxiety disorders,hi even though thankfully your parents responded well to you telling them and you received treatment its possible and very normal for sexual abuse trauma to affect you in different ways as you age and develop please see a therapist who can help you find the root of the anxiety

it seems to me that there is a pattern he easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the childs life but wants a relationship with them when they are older ive tried to research online but im not getting any answers he also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder he also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have where do you recommend researching this",marriageaddiction,mood disorders,this sounds really difficult and i can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband continues to have a relationship with you and your children with that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for in order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do  while it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices
162,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxietytrauma,anxiety disorders,while anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come this is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially this fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again however as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online
163,i dont love my sister i would never wish her harm but if i could i would wish for us not to be related is this cruel why must blood mean we have to be friends am i being unreasonable and is there a way to fix this i do care about her like i do every human being but id rather be with my friends than be with her at all its not just a teenager phase i still love my mom and dad and im very close to them however its my sister i dont love or have ever really liked at all,family conflict,mood disorders,not liking someone is not cruel  even if it is a family member there is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well other dont we all have different personalities and we are not going to like everyone  even if they are related in fact sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each others flaws and imperfections with that being said  it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect and sometimes actually liking each other
164,"sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven 
when i think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good i feel overwhelmed i dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever sometimes i just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety 
am i crazy i dont think these thoughts are normal",anxietyspirituality,anxiety disorders,you might be surprised how normal you are anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you  it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die  regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold it is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown  just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence what these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety mindfulness based practices like meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment the more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true mindfulness practices can help you ground be where you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now  rather than worrying about what happens after you die having said all that  it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety  especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and cant get to sleep there are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety
165,i was raped by multiple men and now i cant stand the sight of myself i wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife,selfesteemmarriagetraumaintimacy,mood disorders,i am very sorry to hear about your rapes  traumatic events such as rape can have some lasting effects  issues with sex drive are one of these effects  therapy can help to decrease the impact that traumatic events have upon our lives as we process through some of our experiences   emdr can be a particularly effective modality of treatment to address this issues  i would also encourage you to have an honest conversation with your wife about this concern  sometimes it is helpful to have that conversation with a therapist so that the therapist can help educate  your wife in regards to effects of trauma  this may help her understand that your feelings are more about the trauma and less about her as a person  best of luck to you
166,i was raped by multiple men and now i cant stand the sight of myself i wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife,selfesteemmarriagetraumaintimacy,mood disorders,hello utah thank you for writing with your question sexual assault or sexual abuse is a very traumatic event that affects victims in many ways your difficulty in feeling sexually engaged and your description of the shame and selfloathing you feel are normal responses to the rapes you experienced a good therapist can help you to process your traumas and understand that you did nothing wrong to cause the rapes the shame is not yours it takes a very patient and loving partner but you can make progress towards a healthier sexual relationship with your wife these are issues that i cannot address more fully here other than to recommend that you seek the assistance of a qualified professional
167,my boyfriends sneaky and puts his friends before me he fights just to leave one day hes happy the next hes mean and blames me for everything he cant admit faults he thinks hes perfect and does no wrong,relationships,anxiety disorders,hi ontario i live in the other ontario in canada ill try to help you sort this out you have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend it sounds like hes maybe a bit immature and moody and these things affect you for sure i get it its got me curious and if i was working with you id want to know a lot more about how long youve been together and whats actually working well between you two i would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description what tells you hes sneaky does he lie how do you know he lies to you also are you wanting to make things better with him do you just want an ear to vent to are you looking for validation or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation  it helps me if i know what you wantwhenever i meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend i encourage them first to look at the language theyre using some of your words tell me that you think you know what hes thinking that he wants to fight so he can leave that he thinks hes perfect its always tricky when we assume what someones thinking and in an argument or dialogue these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument id encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours because you really cant know what hes thinking unless he tells you as a general rule the when you do x i feel y sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feelso its fair to say when you lie to me i cant trust you or when you end our date early to hang with your friends i feel like im not important to you or your mood swings are difficult for me or i dont seem to get apologies from you try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff a relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationshipthat said i have to askif you havent been with mr not so great for very long is it maybe time to rethink the relationship unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that youre leaving out you dont seem happy a good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship if that is whats happening theres a lot to sort out herehow to communicate about your needs how to know when to call it quits if something doesnt feel good i wish you the best as you continue to examine these questions with assistance from friends or professionals
168,i dont love my sister i would never wish her harm but if i could i would wish for us not to be related is this cruel why must blood mean we have to be friends am i being unreasonable and is there a way to fix this i do care about her like i do every human being but id rather be with my friends than be with her at all its not just a teenager phase i still love my mom and dad and im very close to them however its my sister i dont love or have ever really liked at all,family conflict,mood disorders,hi my guess is theres a lot of deep history here that i dont know about have you felt hurt by your sister in the past or are you just different people its a common feeling people have about siblings that theyre very different and they wouldnt choose them as friends but most people stay connected to family unless theres a good reason not to we dont choose our family do we your feelings are normal and they dont make you cruel if you were mean to her that might be a different thing it might be considered cruel to cut her out of your life for no reason but choosing to not hang out with her a lot isnt cruel in my mind perhaps you at least owe your sister kindness and respect if she respects you but not necessarily friendship how you respond here is up to you there are no rules you get to decide how much family means to you and how much time you spend with friends or family this may shift at different times in your life though cutting all ties with a sister now you havent said you want that though might mean she wont want to be there for you in the future when you need her also how you treat your sister affects your other family members as well there are many things to consider here but the bottom line is that you get to surround yourself with the people you want in your life
169,my exboyfriend will not stop harassing and stalking me we work together i honestly think he needs help to move on his accusations are angry lies but i think he may believe them to be true,relationshipslegal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,the specific laws about this will vary from state to state  generally the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else or if they are unable to care for themself  more importantly is dealing with your safety  most states have laws that make stalking a crime you might want to think about filing a police report and obtaining a restraining order against him  you could also think about contacting a local counselor while you cant force him to get help with moving on from the relationship counseling could help you to deal with what is going on
170,my exboyfriend and i met over a year ago we hit it off and fell in love pretty quick however he has trust issues and assumed i was cheating when i found out i was pregnant we had just broken up five months later i lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid i will hurt him again i just want to know where to go with this because i love him so much and i want to get back to us being happy and a family,relationships,anxiety disorders,im truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time when we are in relationships trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship  often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive  in situations like this i often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner  your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact if you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them  you can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses  in the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him  you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust  you may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well  but in terms of your question only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense
171,my exboyfriend and i met over a year ago we hit it off and fell in love pretty quick however he has trust issues and assumed i was cheating when i found out i was pregnant we had just broken up five months later i lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid i will hurt him again i just want to know where to go with this because i love him so much and i want to get back to us being happy and a family,relationships,anxiety disorders,trust is essential in romantic relationships and it is common to have trust issues  because the stakes are so high if both of you are committed and willing to be fully honest with each other trust can be repaired and become stronger than ever i would encourage you to seek out professional help as it easy to get derailed by fear when trying to work things out in the absence of trust when fear takes over  we tend to become defensive and act in ways that makes it harder to trust one another in addition to getting professional support i would encourage you to learn more about building trust in relationships and deepening connection through accessing various online resources on relationships
172,she treats me like im not in her presence shes always yelling at me for no reason she gives more respect to my brothers than me but only my brothers fight her while i respect her,family conflict,mood disorders,attention is not equal to love and being valued it may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your moms attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them it is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who dont demand as much attention end up feeling invisible it sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you  this sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out
173,after  years i fell in love for the first time the person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye my heart is burning and i cant take this pain,relationships,anxiety disorders,ouch losing someone you love hurts so much we all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful while it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances i would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life when we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family while no one is going to be able to make it better we dont have to be alone with our pain if you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see  a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for
174,i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,selfesteem,mood disorders,as social creatures we humans all long for deep human connection to know that we belong and are part of something larger it is so important to us that when we feel alone  it can feel almost unbearable you are not alone in feeling alone while it can take time to build deep relationships there are moments in each day where we have the opportunity to interact with other people who may also feel lonely and scared and want to be seen and acknowledged i wonder what it might be like for you if you took on an experiment of trying to really see the people around you and make little attempts to acknowledge and connect with them  fellow humans on this journey of life a good morning at the bus stop or really looking at the person who you buy your groceries from or thanking or complimenting someone for something that you notice and appreciate while this is not a substitute for close relationships these moments of real connection with the people who we share our communities with can go a long way to realizing that we are not as alone as we may have thought
175,i am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried viagra cialis etc  nothing seemed to work  my girlfriend of  years is very sexually frustrated  i told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men  is that really okay,human sexualityrelationships,anxiety disorders,hi first and foremost i want to acknowledge your efforts to gain your ideal erectile function if the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed i would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological andor relational issue rather than a physicalmedical one as for your question only you can answer this is it ok are you ok with her sleeping with others have you thought through what this may look like feel like become for you and her opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer even then the answer may change at any point by either of you i encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up ie are there any kinds of sex that is off limits areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed are uses of safer sex required or not do you want to know the details or not so forth an excellent resource would be the book opening up by tristan taormino i wish you the best of luckdr lily zehner mftc
176,"i am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life i had a daughter with my exboyfriend i am now married and my husbands exgirlfriend is involved with my exboyfriend  they also have a daughter together my issue is that there is always drama i am pregnant and i told my exboyfriend that i dont want any drama or arguments i want to get along as much as possible and he agreed however we just had an incident where my exboyfriend started discussing dropoff details about my stepdaughter i told him that he needed to ask my husband because i cant make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter that led to an argument i told him all my concern is when i pick up my daughter my stepdaughters pickup details are between my husband and his exgirlfriend i especially told him i didnt want to be involved somehow he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on he threatened me and got ugly because i wouldnt discuss my stepdaughters matters with him

the point is there is so much drama i try my best to get along with everyone i dont understand where i went wrong besides replying back to his question i feel like im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other and its the children that are hurting i had a party planned for my daughters birthday and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her in my eyes its the child that is hurting i was throwing a party for her birthday and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter which i have no control over he took it out on our daughter",family conflictrelationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,hi i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing your exboyfriend seems more focused on his own needs in fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation i agree this is a problemi also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress honour this instinct you have i will suggest a few things to you first to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter it will help you feel supportedknow that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him you cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationkeep on defining clear boundaries you might sound like a broken record youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable its okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryregarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states x and you are not following our agreement your daughter doesnt have to be aware i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflicta professional therapist can help you with all of this i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself 
177,after  years i fell in love for the first time the person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye my heart is burning and i cant take this pain,relationships,anxiety disorders,hi san diego im sad that this was your first experience in  years with feeling in love you deserve better my understanding of todays western social cultural norms is that it is somehow acceptable to abruptly stop communicating with someone youve been seeing without explanation i dont get it its rude youre better off without this person around there are still people who operate with respect but this person isnt one of themif im reading this right you knew this person for a week in my humble opinion much heartache and many poor relationships come from attaching too soon it takes years to get to know someone deeply i know its hard to keep yourself from falling in love but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happensif i was your therapist id be curious about how this is the first time youve fallen in love or is it that you were in love  years ago  was your heart broken then or did something encourage your heart to close what has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now is there a danger that you will decide love isnt worth the risk this is a crucial time for you to potentially seek professional support from a therapist in order to understand yourself and not shut down if thats what happened before 
178,"every once and a while i think about my exboyfriend from four years ago and my current friend its like i cant get past it and i need some kind of closure i keep thinking about how we had something but it got cut off due to parental intervention nothing was ever wrong with it now weve become friends but theres this huge sexual tension between us or at least i feel it when were physically in the same place

two summers ago we saw each other casually for a while but we never had sex then or while we were dating which was only for two months three years ago im now in my s and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his s despite the age difference i know were a really good match weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out i tell him everything also my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing that summer i told him i didnt want anything serious and broke it off only a week later he had gotten back together with his girlfriend his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited im sure she may be different around him but i worry about him committing to her in the long run theyre supposed to move in together soon but still i feel this connection with my exboyfriend and i feel like he does too 

i dont know what to do i need some closure or im not going to be able to move on from this i dont know what it is but its driving me crazy im so happy with my current boyfriend and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling hes such a good person i also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but i cant get it out of my head im trying to take a nap right now between classes but i cant sleep because my mind is racing ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever

i want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but i dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face if he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me if my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed on one hand i want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too where would i go from there on the other hand i feel like i cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but i dont want to

please help me because i really have no idea what to do",relationships,anxiety disorders,if youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that although you say youre happy id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason thats a pretty important element to be missingit may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex if you feel the need to see what is possible there i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first you cant have everythingif you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship the grass isnt greener a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future
179,every time i speak he says i anger him also when hes mad at something like work he gets angry at me i feel like were so distant from each other now we used to laugh all the time and i feel like he lets too much negativity in what should i do weve been married for two years but together for seven,marriageanger management,mood disorders,hi newark it sounds to me like your husband is going through something and i think you understand that you might feel very helpless sad and disrespected at the same time hes changed its unfair for him to blame you for his emotions his mood issues are about him not you and hes either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries you can let him know when you feel disrespected and whats not okay with youhe may be experiencing depression which often shows up as irritability in men it could be that hes not telling you something or hes unaware of his emotional processes you can try a im really worried about you you dont seem happy and i dont know how to help you some things are happening that arent okay with me will you see a therapist approach perhaps you could go with him the first time  its about a combination of compassion selfrespect and seeking professional help i believe i wish you well
180,for the last year my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting im at my wits end how can i get them to stop and get along,parenting,anxiety disorders,that is a good question unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict
181,i use to be so happy no matter what i always was happy i got into a relationship with this guy i love him so much were both teenagers the week after his birthday my mom made me stop talking to him it broke me he came to my house and talked to her and she let us date again but not see each other he comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that i have to lie to her,relationshipsfamily conflict,mood disorders,i understand that this can be difficult when you care about someone have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other and what her concerns are it sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating and compromising it is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having  to lie to your mom it  would be helpful if she could understand that you having to lie to he is getting in the way of you being able to go to her with any issue and  feel she will hopefully understand or try to understand where you are coming from  have either one of you been in family therapy this may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from if your mood is sad and your feeling worse it is important that you reach out to an adult parent person at school whom you trust to share your feelings and help you feel understood and work through your problems
182,my husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person before he worked and slept and on off days hed stay home because he didnt want to do anything else now hes going out with friends several nights a week while im still home working a  hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself hes suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife but the whole time im remembering how ive been emotionally starving for the last five years,marriage,mood disorders,it seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally  could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression obviously something has shifted which you do not understand therefore  perhaps you should consider attending couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings  it would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection or shut down connection imago dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches  validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection

197,my dad cheated on my mom for  years i cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when i know he isnt i have full access to his phone social media and emails i never find anything but im obsessed with constantly checking just in case how do i stop this its driving a wedge between us,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi greenville i respect that youre owning your own overreactions and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves the truth is that some people cheat and some dont and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trustedthe answer here is in two different areas basically if you want to feel differently more trusting in your case you look at your thoughts and your behavioursyour thoughts are stuck like tires in deep ruts in the road these thoughts are only habits they dont reflect the truth fear is probably whispering in your ear things like everyone cheats or  youre not enough for him once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you picture those words in red next time they come up ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there wont be muchperhaps none and what is the evidence that doesnt support it i know lots of good men i know i deserve love and loyalty there is no sign of infidelity youre learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear thats the first half practise these thoughtsthe rest of the work is in your behaviours act as though you trust him force yourself to not check or interrogate and the less you check the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel acting as if something if true strangely helps us believe itits possible to change the way we think and this is turn changes the way we feel try this to start and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it good luck
198,whether its to a guy or girl i always feel insecure talking and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough even when i am walking i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,selfesteemsocial relationships,mood disorders,hi im glad you wrote because i think a lot of people have this same issue to different degrees and we dont talk about it much you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so thats a good thing but your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across as you age you understand this more and its truethat other people really arent thinking about you much or monitoring you at all theyre too busy having the same thoughts youre having am i good enough do people like me judge methink im weird were all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across like many people you lack compassion for yourself acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself my gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past our sensitivities usually come from as well as genetics a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times without more details its difficult to go further here i recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully
199,i have an eating disorder of binging ive had gastric sleeve surgery i need help with issues of abuse as a child addiction and abusive men i have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist,professional ethics,anxiety disorders,hi anaheimrelationships with therapists have some things in common with other relationships they work best if there is dialogue about what your hopes thoughts emotions and needs are are you letting your therapist know what your goals are its okay to say id really like us to focus on this piece or im looking for specific direction about how to manage this part your therapist is wise if they ask questions that determine what your needs are but they cant read your mind not every therapist will be a good fit for you i know im not a good fit for everyone i meet we have different styles some are more  passive and focus on listening this might be the type of therapist you have for some people this is what they want but maybe its not for you maybe you want someone who digs at you more asks more questions gives you strategies lets you know what they think someone more active if this is the case it doesnt mean shes a bad therapistits just not what youre looking for sometimes people think they cant end sessions with their therapist they might be worried about hurt feelings but in the end you dont owe your therapist anything if you feel its not working or its not a good match just move on and try someone new maybe ask them questions first about their style even best of luck
200,my fiancé doesnt think i trust him because i was cheated on before however he hides his phone and has been texting his exgirlfriend who he has two kids with what should i do,relationships,anxiety disorders,oh chino i only have half the picture here so i will be cautious theres a chicken and an egg and i dont know which came first one thing i see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex because they have children can you accept that when suspicion and insecurity come along your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture is there any real evidence that he is cheating remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids has he earned your trust if so then its not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others hes not your ex reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that at the same time you can let him know what your triggers are for example hiding his phone doesnt send you a good message right see this is the chicken and the eggis he hiding the phone because youve been overreacting when he gets a text  so let him know you wont blow up about him getting a text if he doesnt conceal or password his phone transparency helps build trust you have sensitivities and it helps you a lot if hes aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear let him know when you get scared and hopefully hell give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him  
201,i am an international student and it is my first semester in graduate school in the united states i faced a cultural shock and i was so depressed when i arrived here my counselor in the university was my savior he helped me a great deal now i am going back to my country for a vacation i was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and i remembered that he likes wine my country is known for that is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after christmas,professional ethics,anxiety disorders,hi different therapists are guided by the ethical guidelines of their own associations or colleges when it comes to receiving gifts so this may differ a bit from therapist to therapist its important to me that i be sensitive to cultural norms and to my clients needs in canada and the us it is customary for people to sometimes express gratitude with a small gift and i have from time to time received small tokens of appreciation because i believe it would be rude to refuse this it is never necessary to give a therapist a gift but if you wish to express your gratitude in this way i dont think its inappropriate
202,a friend of mine taking psychology advised i go to my doctor to check if i have major depressive disorder im afraid of the consequences of doing so if i do become diagnosed with major depressive disorder wont that go on my records i will never be able to become a counselor along with a list of other things i may be prohibited from im also afraid of taking any antidepressants this year my doctor gave me some for a dislocated hip i had a severe reaction and passed out moments after taking them everyone i know who has taken antidepressants says its a bad idea all around and youre better getting treatment without them im concerned they might take me to a clinic and force me to take medication because i am unable to make decisions on my own im not really suicidal but i am not really taking care of myself either someone also told me they still use electroshock therapy im not keen on that im wondering if i am better off just getting selfhelp and working things out on my own its just that ive been an emotional mess since i was in elementary school ive graduated now and tried to stay positive and be happy but i cannot deny i still am not good,depressionanxiety,anxiety disorders,i admire your courage for stating your view about antidepressants  questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a personas a therapist i always tell my patients to avoid antidepressantstheir effectiveness is in suppressing a persons mood and feelings  if someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from othersantidepressants mask how someone feelsin a crisis temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful  if someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then  suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short whilebasically respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants   your view is shared by many   it is a minority opinion and very valid if you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressantsideally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematici hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search
203,i was mentored by this guy for a few years spiritually it was okay at times but other times it was just weird i try not to think about it too much but a lot of manipulation and lying happened yet no one else really believed me when i told them its like hes two different people and no one else really sees that side of him i was blamed for a lot of our troubles and now we dont really talk much im worried because hes in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything they just think im attacking his character how do i know for sure,social relationships,anxiety disorders,you may intuitively be sensing what many professionals in the social sciences and psychology have already understoodjust google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these rolestheoretically is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths  well yes  and i consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people  being able to recognize social dynamics is a strength that you havepsychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopathsi agree with you about not being able to change peoples minds who are attached to this persons interactionsthe only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity and you have evidence of this that you contact relevant authoritiesno one is allowed to break laws including psychopaths
204,when i see something i dont like i go off like a ticking time bomb i go from  to  really quickly,anger management,anxiety disorders,sometimes we react to situations immediately without thinking of the consequences of our actions typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly one of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing when faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend  minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to  and breathe out even slower counting to  while focusing and thinking only about your breathing after doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate good luck

206,i am always arguing with my father he gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling i get upset often at this am i too sensitive he always says i am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings no matter how often i try to tell him this he never listens,family conflict,mood disorders,thanks for the question regardless of whether or not you are sensitive it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you when we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed it is difficult to not take it personally it sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context begin your statements with i as opposed to you for example you can tell him i feel angry when you raise your voice at me instead of you always yell at me also avoid using black and white terms such as never and always additionally offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you maybe he just doesnt know how to lastly when delivering a message i like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive for example you may say something to the effect ofdad i enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion there are times that i feel angry when you talk to me aggressively perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when i bring up heated topics lets try and work on this together i will try to be less sensitive and i am asking that you be more calmi hope you find this useful
207,im in a longdistance relationship with my ideal man but im not as attracted to him as i should be everything else is perfect about him but i find myself lusting over more attractive men the next step is marriage but i want to marry someone who i can wake up to and fall in love with all over again however i also dont want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust am i asking for too much in the perfect guy is there such a thing am i truly in love,relationships,anxiety disorders,hi montgomery your first sentence says it all he might be an amazing person but theres something missing for you im curiousyou say this is a long distance relationship did you make a connection through social media or email first maybe a dating website im just wondering if this is the case these modern ways of meeting people are awesome because we can be exposed to a wide variety of people who we never would meet in the grocery store or a friends party there are complications though and one of the drawbacks is you can feel very connected to someone and care about them a great deal before you ever meet them in person then when you finally meet them and there isnt that spark of magnetic physical attraction youre in a bit of a difficult spot because youve already established that youre drawn to each other in other ways youre already connected it can be very awkward then to say now that i meet you it doesnt feel the way it should for me in the future i suggest meeting up in person early on to answer that crucial question are we physically attracted to each other clearly this is not only important for you but it is for most of usmy guess is that you feel you owe this man your affection and commitment even though youre not really all that into him lusting after other men is a sign of that because you like absolutely everything else about him but honesty is crucial here both with yourself and this man just because you dont find yourself attracted to him doesnt mean that youre a bad person or that hes not attractive someone else might drool over him and i think he deserves someone who does just that you can have both love and lust for most people only one of them isnt enough
208,my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had i know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over that i am messing around which i am not,marriage,mood disorders,hi louisianaits normal when trust has been broken in the past for fear and insecurities to come up from time to time his reactions may not mean that he doesnt trust you but rather that he gets scared that hes going to be hurt again youre a bit vague about the past you dont say whether you cheated or not if you did then you might try taking an approach where you a take responsibility for your past actions b show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that c do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority and d reassure him when he says hes scared or feeling insecure im suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that youre so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear this is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injurypart of the issue might be that when he brings it up hes coming across as angry accusing or suspicious rather than scared and insecure this often happens a therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger which is also natural but less helpful in those moments and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him as much as you want to forget about it he might need to talk about it sometimes and thats normal his needs are important also important however is your need for respect if he approaches it in a disrespectful way thats a separate problem if its brought up as a weapon used to shut you down or used to control or punish those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts you can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the pasta qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory best of luck

while im not quite ready to be in one anyway i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one i dont take medications and have no desire to i have read forums and ive talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems",depressionanxietyrelationships,anxiety disorders,hi helenai felt a bit sad when i read this this is a new term for me semirelationship what does it mean i know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore that makes me feel sad i hear a lot of young women im not sure youre female but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty i think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the endthis is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect thatmaybe take a moment and listen to anxiety anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions what am i afraid of what is the worst thing that might happen here then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurtthen when you find that core fear you can look at your life and i bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated a big moment or many smaller ones when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt in the end its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious but this doesnt work for you good with the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence

226,i just got married with my husband i have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past i know all marriages have problems but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust its hard for me to let go because i love him but i am getting tired,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,hi louisianayou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshiptrust is the first stage in a relationship moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element but you didnt see this coming did you thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface i give you credit for wanting it to work and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust good luck

237,people who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me i have had jobs but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong any time i bring these things up i am expected to be over the issue these are people that you cant just cut out but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain i dont know what to do any more i dont know who i am anymore,depressionfamily conflict,mood disorders,it sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life you are feeling invalidated it also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued in working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you
238,that phrase makes me crazy it happens anytime i point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his ipad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that i got all the things he needs to bake a pie another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up over and over again he lets the dog run out and i am afraid he will get hit by a car,marriage,mood disorders,its hard to say what is okay and what is not okay as it depends on what you and your husband feel is appropriate in your relationship if you are feeling like you need to walk on eggshells or that you cant speak your mind and say how you feel then that sounds like a problem i would recommend having an open discussion with your husband about communication between the two of you in general do this during a time when there is little or no conflict and emotions are not heightened let him know how you feel and give him specific ideas of how you would like him to respond instead of saying enough additionally try and see his perspective and understand why he shuts you down perhaps he feels like he is being told what to do constantly or that he gets little positive feedback from you an open dialogue about how to discuss issues going forward will likely help seeing a couples therapist will also greatly assist with teaching better communication skills and seeing if there are underlying issues that need resolution best of luck to you guys
239,"my fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression she has had it most of her life her anxiety in public places is the worst it gets to points where she cant breathe or move sometimes she wont even go to the restroom so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself she curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks she wont eat or drink in public if she isnt having a panic attack or crying shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming she get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that i cant even get her to eat drink leave the bed or go outside she always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds yelling conflict and even talking to strangers in public she will refuse to go to a store unless i am with her to talk to the cashier for her she is so scared that i cant even get her to drive she doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive

some people have recommended medication but i believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it i dont want my fiancée pumped with drugs i believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her when we first met my poodle it would calm her down a lot she took the dog out every time we went out and she seemed much calmer and happier she slowly would eat and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better i am worried and want to help her without medication",depressionanxiety,anxiety disorders,it sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee there is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you while it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important i suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts you would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship i wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later

253,i found out today that my wife is cheating on me i love her but she wont tell the truth even when i have proof when i beg her to tell the truth she yells cusses and gets a huge attitude,marriage,mood disorders,hi prattville im sorry this is happening to you you need support right now and yes you need answers she is in denial and is trying to hide the truth to protect herself this is a natural behaviour you dont indicate whether she wants the marriage or is planning to leave which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question if she wants the marriage you certainly have the right to say i need answers to all my questions giving you the information she needs has to be if she wants the marriage more important than protecting herself i would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions she may fear that the truth will turn you away if you want to you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is if the marriage is to survive it needs opennessif on the other hand shes planning to end the marriage then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek you are better off in that case seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door your wife has some decisions to make try to give her a bit of time to make them you can patiently say i know this thing is happening talk to me so we can deal with it together i want to move forward but i need the truth only time and a good therapist if she is willing and wants the marriage will tell which way this one will go individually you can seek professional help as well
254,i never get infections or scars or anything and it doesnt bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something but im concerned,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,hi houston the fact that youre concerned says a lot if i was your therapist id ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life youre causing perhaps permanent changes damage to your body and its likely youre trying to express somethingpain maybe a therapist can help you to explore whats going on for you and how to get your needs for selfexpression met in a more healthy way good luck
255,i never feel like myself i cant even think straight anymore i start stuttering and i cant remember anything i always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with what feels like someone else i dont know why i feel this way but i hate it,behavioral changeanxiety,anxiety disorders,hi houston okay somethings definitely going on right my gut is to start with your family physician because you have some physical symptoms while it seems anxiety is a likely problem here your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy without knowing more thats all i can say at this point best of luck

257,"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal

most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes",relationshipsselfesteemanxiety,anxiety disorders,i think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is whats the rush  just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that theres something wrong or something to be ashamed of  if anything i want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it  one of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you  they dont see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective its important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals  once you stop comparing your happiness you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down
258,at school it feels like ive lost all my friends and ive been really weird with my sleeping patterns i used to cut myself and i really want to again but i change in the locker rooms because i dont want anybody to see i get ticked off easy and overreact at night im very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff please help me i just want to be happy again and i feel like im starting to fake a smile at school,depressionsleep improvement,mood disorders,as silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of restful sleep is very important when we are feeling low  the reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking  i know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events  in regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced  as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you  one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and i would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future
259,for my whole life ive been very unconfident insecure and selfquestioning im super quiet because im scared of what people will think of me i avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety it is how both of my parents have always been and i feel like im doomed to that life also it makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because im too nice it causes me depression and brings me down im in my early twenties and i really need to create a better life for myself ive been like this for so long so how do i change,anxietyselfesteemworkplace relationships,anxiety disorders,one of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves  despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries  once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries  in effect assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem you may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation   one of the workbooks that i have found to be very helpful is the assertiveness workbook how to express your ideas and stand up for yourself at work and in relationships by randy j paterson
260,im scared that i am with this man so i wont be alone he should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case and i dont want to hurt him,selfesteemrelationships,mood disorders,while not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think  since you seem to care about your friend dont want to hurt him i imagine there are many other reasons that you are together  i suggest that you talk about this openheartedly with each other  the idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place  dont try to figure out whether you should be with him  just talk  the communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for both of youin the meantime your idea that you dont deserve him is rooted in a core lie that you are telling yourself  you can read about core lies and much more in my book living yes a handbook for being human  check out wwwlivingyesorgbe easy on yourself  you are deservingmark
261,my mom and i have been fighting a lot now and i just want a good relationship with her,family conflict,mood disorders,the best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively  one of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response  often the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication the hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times

263,i have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now in the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating we argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work i used to party a lot and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else these situations were never more than just kissing i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me i love him so much and want to work things out too but im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me i cant seem to forgive myself im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness,relationshipsselfesteem,mood disorders,hi cerritosthis is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness you are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made you dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man you only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made were you shamed as a child did you learn that you deserved to be punished did something bad happen that you thought was your fault is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for the bar is too high for you if i was your therapist i would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that wound if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you cant erase it and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore you have done many things here that you can feel proud of youve come clean youve been honest youve taken responsibility for your actions youve not tried to minimize what you did and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth you are acting very honourably its time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that youve learned from them and are a better person now its not our mistakesnot our worst moments that define usits how we handle them afterwardsi wish you growth and happiness
264,when im not cutting im drinking when i try healthy outlets such as exercise i end up running myself down into an asthma attack from weapons to words i cant help but self harm what am i supposed to do how do i stop this cycle i dont know how else to cope or motivate myself without pain,selfesteem,mood disorders,it sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control you are concerned about your behavior and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it in working with a therapist you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors develop strategies for taking care of yourself and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic self
265,its not entirely true to say i enjoy being sad but i always find a way to feel that way i listen to sad music read tragic stories and in a twisted way like how bad it makes me feel i focus on negative aspects of my life even if they arent legitimate or i just make it seem negative,depression,mood disorders,it sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and its hard to understand why this may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way a simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using now i am not saying that what you describe is an addiction it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefitone thing i would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content id also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings these are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist
266,"i have an exboyfriend who just lies about everything he is super lazy he lies to everyone that he has a good job builds trust and then start borrowing moneyand large amounts too it has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends he is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story borrow money then disappear he refuses to work so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends i used to think his lying was due to his drug habit but now im hearing from other exfriends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life he would borrow anywhere from  to  from everyone and it would all disappear hes in debt with bills he doesnt gamble but he spends his money on random stuff

although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money he seems to be a good person hell always give a homeless person all his change no matter what my brother has epilepsy and is really antisocialmy exboyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother he takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him he drives me to school and work every day and picks me upjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that hes not totally a horrible human being is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there",behavioral change,anxiety disorders,it sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out you notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another one question that i would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist another question i would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him
267,"about two and a half months ago i met a woman on a dating site we went out on two dates and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date we respectfully tried not to have sex but after hours of trying to resist each other we gave in and we had sex after that i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks then one day she went to her familys house on thanksgiving and everything changed within the short time we were together we got so close and serious really fast we had finally found each other we told each other that we loved each other all the time even while we were making love a few days after thanksgiving she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently i was very hurt and didnt understand then another week later she told me she couldnt do it at all anymore i was crushed

a few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her so for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen she had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused she doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly i know she needs time and all i can do is take care of myself we have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again im completely in love with her and im in extreme pain",relationships,anxiety disorders,love doesnt hurtyour description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this womanin some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care aboutthis sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one  your descriptions are of the womans life parenting and relationship dilemmas not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long termtry distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday lifebeing aware of how much love youd like to give and receive is valuable selfknowledgeyour ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you being the result of the womans choices sounds like the opposite of lovethe relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes  it sounds like this is its main value in your life not that it is sustainable in realitygood luck
268,i have major depression severe ptsd anxiety disorder and personality disorder i had an appointment with my doctor i was very upset and i shared with him about that particular drug,legal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist  especially if your doctor is concerned about your safetyit was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on  i know that must have been difficult to talk about with him  by having that conversation you are helping your primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your health
269,an organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies the study was to implant a fantasy other people are having but to me its a nightmare i lost my kids my job and all that i was an unwilling participant i no longer trust a therapist  im too afraid to go under hypnosis or anything,trauma,mood disorders,given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable there is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause i understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves a therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again if therapy feels too unsafe at the moment i would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques acceptance and commitment therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy you may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstacle
270,"im an early  something yearold virgin and my boyfriend is in his early s with kids hes cheated on me twice once in the beginning and then four months ago he wasnt use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasnt sure we both work at the same job where we met and its with the girl that works with us ive been trying to get over it but now my confidence and selfesteem are low and sometimes i feel like hell do it again or that hes not ready to be with me i think about it all over again when i see her he says hes in love with me and with the last time he cheated it didnt feel right and thats when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me hes contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because hes in a relationship with me

how do i gain confidence should i let him go if i let him go i dont want to be sad about it being that we work together i try to tell myself im beautiful every day and i think i am a pretty attractive female with a great personality but i dont like the fact that she works there",relationships,anxiety disorders,sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationshipyoure on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriendsince he was the one who broke your trust he is one in the position of earning back your trustthis is always a basic formula for couples therapy in which there has been infidelityunderstand within yourself whether youd like being with your boyfriend and what youd like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationshipif yes then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationshipfor example some people who are getting over being cheated on would like knowing details about the affair person some people want to see the phone of the one who cheatedrecuperating after a cheating incident takes many monthsif he tells you hed like earning back your trust give him some time to see if there is progress in this areaas results unfold you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally takingabout the girl at work she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationshipshe has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to takeas you go along this road more than likely youll be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you
271,i have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years and it hits me harder every time it comes back this past time it was extremely debilitating so i went on wellbutrin i could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week a month and a half later i decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair i became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what i needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment i stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away however i still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained and i have days where i feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should i go back on the medicine,depression,mood disorders,deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications while there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well while i cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication i would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication if you can find a doctor psychiatrist or arnp who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with themone thing that i am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group while there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference
272,my husband and i have been together since high school we have been married going on for nearly ten years and we have three beautiful children a few weeks ago my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dads for a while he comes home to see the kids and acts like there is not too much wrong can this marriage be saved or is it too late he said he would go to counseling so i dont think he has given up,marriage,mood disorders,while it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support with appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible im not familiar with the resources available in jackson but im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy so often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress loneliness anger and resentment i commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children the following links provides more information regarding common behaviours that predict staying together or separating and also videos and other resources that can help you get started wishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discovery

274,"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal

most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes",relationshipsselfesteemanxiety,anxiety disorders,i think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries  myself included since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single it is similar to fearing that we wont ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we wont be healthy when we have been sick we fear these things because they are so important  not because these fears are realistic or true there is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience dating etc while some people may judge an adult who is a virgin  others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices experimenting with sex so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal since expectations vary and we cant be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique virgin or not when we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness not a real word but you get what i mean then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort  putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships when you are most afraid of being alone  remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be normal or whatever that is anyway hope this helps

277,i dont know whats with me im almost constantly angry even when im happy i still feel anger inside me when i acknowledge it it ruins my mood and takes over i get angry at the littlest things even if i think someone said something they didnt it infuriates me something perfectly normal can make me go off when my anger flares up i get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while its like there is a fire constantly burning in my body and anger is gasoline,anger management,anxiety disorders,hi nashville im glad you want this to be different it doesnt feel good to be angry all the time and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships im sureworking with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that so when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something youd rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is in that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face or the shoe that someone left in front of the doorits that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on firei suggest finding a therapist to work with you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them 
278,my mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back and i cant seem to forgive her i want to say that its okay but i cant i feel like even if i did forgive her i wouldnt be able to say it to her face,family conflict,mood disorders,hi cleveland i think i get what youre feeling youre scared that if you forgive your mom that would mean it wasnt so bad or shell think its okay to do it again or she wont realize how hurt you are i invite you to look at forgiveness in a different way forgiveness doesnt have to mean what she did was okay not at all forgiveness can mean i accept what she did and i dont want to live in her worst moments constantly i want to put it down and move past it because i want her in my life because fear and resentment interfere with my relationship with her and mostly because im tired of carrying them fear and resentment around constantlyyou can forgive your mom for yourself not for her  if there is evidence that your mom wants to respect you moving forward then it might be worth it to risk putting down the resentment and the grudge that you think you need to protect yourself  your ability to draw boundaries with her in the present is your biggest protector let her know in the present what hurts you and notice her responsesyou dont have to say it to her face saying it to yourself is more important again forgiving your mom helps youit reduces your own burden of fear and resentment leaving space for better things
279,my exhusband told my two adolescents that santa doesnt exist on the day before christmas they are desperate to hold on to the magic of christmas but i dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that santa is real i dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories but i also dont want to lose their trust,parenting,anxiety disorders,well boise the cats out of the bag now isnt it i love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of christmas they must want that too if they still believe in santa into their teen years which is unusual i believe i wonder if they had already figured it out anywaybut they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best so its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and christmas can still be magical in so many ways really who says they have to stop believing in santa santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and love
280,i broke up with him three weeks ago because i felt that he needed to be more respectful he has since had a rebound relationship he says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me he says its going to be too difficult to see me every time we talk it feels like im being pushy to see him he used to be so madly in love with me but now it seems like he couldnt care less i think im running him away,relationships,anxiety disorders,hi kansasi think your first instinct was good you broke up with him you deserve respect but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants which is space do you think hes going to be any different with her this a common unfounded fear we have i wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him the bottom line is you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone be loving towards you because how someone treats you and the choices they make has everything to do with who they are and nothing to do with who you are i hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future
281,my mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back and i cant seem to forgive her i want to say that its okay but i cant i feel like even if i did forgive her i wouldnt be able to say it to her face,family conflict,mood disorders,how someone feels when they forgive another is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong who was responsible for what in the situation and clarity on their own motivation actions emotions including pain regret resentment sadnessthese steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either persons way of handling themselvesthe long answer would be that youre not yet through with this processi commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourselfyoure on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when youve reached resolution and not beforefinding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention sometimes is a frustration of its ownkeep up your good work of knowing your own lifeit is a worthwhile endeavor
282,"ive been with my husband for eight years now we have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated i took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes however we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust my insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again during that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child

the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life

im of course hurt and in shock i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go my heart will still be torn apart i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought",marriageintimacy,mood disorders,hi jayuya im struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cant do that and i dont think either of those things will help you id like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe do you have supports do your family and friends know whats happening in your life have you ever been to a womens shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly thats what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best
283,i crave attention companionship and sex she has had a hysterectomy and she has a bad knee,human sexualityintimacymarriage,mood disorders,hi hamptonalthough id bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now i also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you this is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs if you both want the relationship to improve a couples therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea its a complex picture that youve only given us a glimpse ofin the meantime you can try a few things have compassion for your wife shes in pain and this may preoccupy her sex may be uncomfortable for her she needs understanding you need understanding too right  help her to see that youre not just angry but lonely and hurt it might affect how you see yourself as a man showing her irritability or anger might push her farther awaythere are many ways to be close intimate and sexual that dont involve intercourse you might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you wont pressure her to have intercourse find out what your wifes wishes and ideas are you might be surprisedthese things take time to address especially if theyve been years in the making i do recommend seeing that therapist relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change best of luck
284,my girlfriend and i have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years we recently just broke up again last night on new years eve when we break up the very next day she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened she acts like everything is alright this has been going on for two years i do love her and care about her and her children a lot but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man she is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man it makes me feel like crap because i cannot give her everything that she wants she told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her is that a normal thing that women want or should i just move on already i am in my s and she is in her s,relationships,anxiety disorders,love is not enough to keep a relationship togetherthe people need to get along happily toolets start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partnerthe frequent break ups happen for a reason  try understanding more of why you go back together againyou state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship such as feeling like crap and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave hertrust your intuition telling you that these feelings mattersometimes men arent sure whether following their instinct is a right action to takeit isalso hoping a partner will fear losing them shows a wish to control a personcontrol has nothing to do with love and trust and these are basics of a relationshipgood luck
285,i am so angry i feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress and i dont know what to do i want to sit down with a psychologist but i cannot afford one nor do i have my own health insurance i can feel myself starting to get violent i throw things of value when i start to get mad i have punched holes in my wall i can feel my aggression getting worse,anger management,anxiety disorders,first off it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made it is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with lifes obstacles including anger management there are several strategies that you can try to help control your anger but the ones that i would recomend first are the following try a different way of communicating with your parents since arguing with them is a great source of anger for you learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit choose a time to talk with them about heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened use i phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on them validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view when you feel yourself becoming angry take a break simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhale even slower counting to  focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for  minutes stop any negative thoughts in their tracks often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly when you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational if you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts finally find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angryi wish you all the best
286,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,addictionsubstance abuse,mood disorders,the first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change  frequently our problems keep us in denial  although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone  the best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together  alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction  know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed i really recommend an inpatient stay for at least  days for anyone who is dealing with addiction whether combined with mental health issues or not  if this is not a possibility then the next best thing would be an intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues  know that there is hope for what you are experiencing  you can get control over these issues  the next step is finding the team andor facility that is going to help you do it
287,my boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend he goes to see her twice a week or more every time she leaves he gets into these funks like when his mom died when shes here shes disrespectful and his answer is well i dont know what to tell you she swears and talks back and he laughs he and her mom have been apart for three years and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young we never have adult time when shes not here shes the golden child and he wont listen to anyone,relationshipsparenting,anxiety disorders,hi lockport building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky you dont tell us whether you live together or not if you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the home a bottom line for me is you dont tell someone else how to parent thats for your boyfriend to decide when hes there hes the parent and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree or you think you see something that hes not seeing its simply not for you to interfere there it sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support he has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned do you talk about these things can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to doalthough i suggest you leave the parenting to him what you can do is tell him what you see offer suggestions if hes open to it and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you it makes sense to say i see you struggling and i dont know how to help ive noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her are you aware that its coming across this way do you need help or i feel sad and frustrated when we dont spend any time alone together you sound a bit resentful of his daughter is it possible that your real struggle is about whether youre ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his childyou have a voice and its great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel ultimately however you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it 
288,i am so angry i feel like the arguments with my parents have caused me so much anxiety and stress and i dont know what to do i want to sit down with a psychologist but i cannot afford one nor do i have my own health insurance i can feel myself starting to get violent i throw things of value when i start to get mad i have punched holes in my wall i can feel my aggression getting worse,anger management,anxiety disorders,im sorry you have so many arguments with your parents  ideally parents are people who tolerate that their kids are people with their own unique characteristicseveryone likes feeling loved by their parent   do you feel loved even though you and them have clashesanger is a symptom of a problemthe real question is knowing what feels like its being hurt inside of youi agree with your idea of talking with a psychologist or some other type of licensed professional therapistsee if your area has a family service agency in it  generally the nonprofit sectors offer sliding scale fees and if you qualify your cost per session would be financially comfortable for youone possibility is to tell your parents that youd like starting therapy because of feeling so much stress from the family arguingthey may very well be surprised to learn of your maturity in assessing your level of stress and be willing to make a positive contribution to this by offering to authorize therapy through their health insurance they may even decide on family counseling so all of you work together to relate in more loving wayslast if you arent ready to speak with your parents about wanting counseling think about speaking to your school guidance counselor  this person may have some recommendations for your specific geographic location
289,just wondering if this is a deviant act and if i should be concerned for him he isnt quite ,parenting,anxiety disorders,well its certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so i would wonder if this child is trying to say somethingi think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on if there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly
290,ive been in a relationship for over a year hes cheated and lied i heard hes married but he says hes not everything is very up and down theres no trust recently he went on a trip and i promised him id behave and not drink because when i drink i drink too much and i tend to make poor choices this time i made a huge mistake i drank too much and i cheated on him i slept with another man for about five minutes before realizing what i was doing is wrong i told him and he just got really rude he called me names and threatened me i feel bad as i do love him we just have so many issues im not a bad person ive just made a lot of bad mistakes its unintentional and i know right from wrong but why do i still make the wrong choice,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi calgary canada  let me get this straightyoure in a relationship but he might be married you both cheat and lie and hes abusive the short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it relationships dont heal us and they dont help us grow up we have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before its going to work id recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while you have a lot to sort out i wish you the best
291,my fiancé and i have been in a relationship for two years we have an infant son my fiancé also has a child from a previous relationship we do not live together i live with my mother currently while i get on my feet and hes living with some friends my mother and i have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time we cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house she has made it clear that she wants me gone recently i was talking to my father who lives in a different state my father and i have always had a good relationship i explained to him the situation i am in with my mother and he said he would like for me my fiancé and our son to come live with him and his wife i would really love to go i do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer there is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state the problem is my fiancé is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child he and his childs mother have a horrible relationship and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away i believe i would be doing what is best for my child by moving away but i do not want to leave without my fiancé i have already explained the situation to him and he will not give in do i continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together do i move away with my child and have my relationship end i do not want to take him out of either of his kids lives what do i do,relationshipsfamily conflictparenting,anxiety disorders,hi bethlehemyou have a big decision to make  i appreciate your fiancés need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe placeim a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together i get that you want your dad to take care of all of you but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent i say that without knowing how old you are but if you have a child and a two year relationship you basically have declared your independence anyway  i wish you the best
292,ever since my exboyfriend and i broke up i cant seem to get close to anyone else i know im completely over him but i just cant break down my walls and let someone new into my life,relationshipssocial relationshipsintimacy,anxiety disorders,hi bend youre scared right that makes sense each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business we are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines  of our happiness in life the good news is that when were just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow i think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here and thats okay we are naturally people of attachment and it wont likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesnt put up walls so part of what i want to say here is dont pressure yourself too much take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow as well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right person first think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship what do you feel proud of what do you need in a partner what mistakes did you make use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partnerlook at your thoughts are you having generalized negative thoughts like no one will ever love me again or im going to get hurt again or i cant trust myself if so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening it sells us a line based on no concrete evidence then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought what is the evidence that i am lovable that there are safe good people out there that i can trust myself eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones its simple but very powerfullastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls what is the evidence of the walls can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls when we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it morei hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time 
293,i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,hello being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her if so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back couples counseling would be of benefit if not then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from there are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them the issue is not likely to get resolved in the meantime i suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship hope it all works out for you both
294,i am lazy i am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time but i never seem to shake the habits i try to think of what it is doing to me and my future but no matter what i keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination all im ever left with is regrets and a low grade i am at an alltime low in my life and im not even that old ive always been a straighta student but now im getting cs and fs and it hurts me to know that i am way better than that its not even like the work is hard,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,i am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time it sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems if not i would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in it is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition most often difficult situations that life throws at us along with an inability to think positively and break bad habits are what cause depression some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable or once pleasurable activities exercise daily and practice thinking more positively set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable additionally keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change which you clearly have once you start feeling better about yourself and your life your grades should naturally begin to improve as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area best of luck to you
295,i have been seeing this guy for a little over a year back in august he asked for us to step back for now since then he has still been in contact with me every day we spent some time together over the holidays but then i was gone for new years with family i came to find out that he put himself on a dating site when i found out i asked him about it and he responded with this my apologies if i got my signals crossed or if i wasnt honest with you you have helped me tons this past year and i am glad you are in my life i didnt realize you were still interested in dating again my apologies also is it better to say that i want him in my life or that i want him as part of my life,relationships,anxiety disorders,it sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other do you know what type of relationship you want with him a friendship only casual dating or an exclusive relationship i would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises by clearing the air and learning what your own and each others desires are you can then move forward with a plan without that clarification there will likely be false assumptions unanswered questions and confusion
296,i am lazy i am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time but i never seem to shake the habits i try to think of what it is doing to me and my future but no matter what i keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination all im ever left with is regrets and a low grade i am at an alltime low in my life and im not even that old ive always been a straighta student but now im getting cs and fs and it hurts me to know that i am way better than that its not even like the work is hard,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,possibly laziness is not the true problem and is only what appears as the problemsince you describe your laziness as an observable quality i assume youve not always felt or handled yourself this wayquite possibly and more likely the particular conditions of your current life are not ones that are optimal for feeling good about yourself and your involvementsone suggestion is to see if there is any purpose to what youre doing in all the areas in which you see yourself acting from lazinessif youre not able to notice any good purpose then you may be mistaking laziness for a significant amount of stress in your lifestress can be opened and understood  if stress is what underlies what appears as laziness then you define the contributors to your stressnot feeling enough support in your life financial uncertainty arguments w people who are close in your life feeling misunderstood overall or by particular people all are possibilitiesgood luck in learning more about who you are
297,i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,instead of fighting about trust is it possible for you and your wife to talk with other about areas which upset each of youwhenever feelings are hurt knowing what exactly is problematic and being heard and understood by the partner goes a long way to building trustthese type of discussions are hard to have and especially for the first time  a lot of emotions arise and often people lose their conversation focus from thisif you and your wife have a tough time opening up to each other consider scheduling time with a couples therapistjust by each of you committing time to invest in the relationship will show faith in the relationship and this may contribute to restoring trust
298,i have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man i talked to her about it and she said she will do it for me the idea excites me to no end but i dont want to because it disgusts me how can i stop wanting it or should i just give into it and do it ive been struggling for years with this it wont go away by the way i am in my mid s and my wife is in her mid s,human sexualitymarriage,mood disorders,try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilledsince you and your wife are in a relationship the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wifei suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangementby anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control or in control since its your wish being fulfilled all the feelings you and her are able to expect youll be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the eventthere are a lot of unknowns in the situation youre considering  having your partner who will be key in satisfying your sex wish be active in understanding these unknowns is a good way of keeping your relationship strong overall
299,"im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend at the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date he has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two i have nothing against her except for the fact that she has tims heart he is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but i dont really believe him 

lately tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year hes been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her but hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves he seems really torn up about it and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves 

he knows that i still crush on him he doesnt rub it in my face hes a good guy but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us how do i do that when the time comes how do i support him and show him that im here without wanting to hook up how do i make him feel better he is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which i think is ridiculous",relationships,anxiety disorders,first off i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelings and understanding regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upim not sure if that is possible if you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues good luck to you
300,my husband and i got into a huge dispute he said he wanted a divorce and i left i still come home a lot and see my kids and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is what does that mean for our marriage,relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,in situations like this in most cases he probably will not fill anytime soon its more of the fact that he isnt ready to give that life yet now if you probably pressured him about it then yes he would probably give in but if it hasnt been a big issue anymore or something you guys arent talking about then right now everything is on a hold

303,i have anger issues that have worsened over the years because ive never dealt with my emotions my anger has never been expressed physically until the past year my girlfriend has had to endure these episodes i love her and i think im about to lose her if i already havent i throw things at her when im angry and sometimes i hit her i may not hit her enough to cause harm but i still physically lash out at her i dont want to lose her and i dont want the situation to worsen i am a lesbian in my early s and i have been dealing with anger since my childhood im ready to change i need help now im about to explode,anger managementdomestic violence,anxiety disorders,good for you for recognizing that a change has to be made quickly regardless of whether or not your girlfriend leaves your relationship taking control of your anger needs to happen sooner than later if left unresolved it will follow you into any relationship you have have you talked to a therapist i would suggest you take that step first a therapist will help you explore the source of your anger and teach you new adaptive ways of dealing with your anger until youre able to get some professional help i would advise that you start recognizing when your emotions are becoming escalated and take a time out before the anger turns into aggression if you feel yourself becoming heated excuse yourself from the situation go to a quiet place or on a walk and practice some deep breathing clear your mind of the problem and focus only on your breathing as you inhale slowly counting to four and exhale slowly counting to six dont get discouraged if it doesnt work right away deep breathing takes practice return to the situation or your girlfriend only once you have calmed down and are confident that you are not going to hurt anyone you might also want to ask your girlfriend to remind you to take a break when she recognizes that your emotions are escalating know that with help and support especially from a therapist the issues you have can be resolved and new ways of coping can be learned good luck
304,my husbands exwife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor he by his own admission is addicted to child pornography my stepdaughters are now all teenagers they do not know my husbands exwife has kept this information from my stepdaughters the stepfather has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently the exwife minimizes it by saying that he has repented it is a constant strain on my husband knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography my own therapist believes the girls should be told the exwife says her therapist says the opposite,parentingfamily conflict,anxiety disorders,lorain youre correct that your husbands exwife is seriously minimizing this problem i have a very strong opinion here in my book the safety of children trumps potentially insulting or hurting the feelings of adults of course the girls should be told because they have the right to know their voice is not the only one im concerned about here though i believe your husband has the right to insist that his daughters be in a safe home and there is clear evidence this man is not safe this woman is putting her own comfort she simply doesnt want to deal with her partners situation her own fears or anyone elses needs above the safety of two vulnerable girls honestly if it was me my kids wouldnt be even visiting that home with that man present repented or not its not worth the risk if she decides to stay with him the natural consequence of having a known perpetrator in your home is not having access to vulnerable children in that same home
305,i have anger issues that have worsened over the years because ive never dealt with my emotions my anger has never been expressed physically until the past year my girlfriend has had to endure these episodes i love her and i think im about to lose her if i already havent i throw things at her when im angry and sometimes i hit her i may not hit her enough to cause harm but i still physically lash out at her i dont want to lose her and i dont want the situation to worsen i am a lesbian in my early s and i have been dealing with anger since my childhood im ready to change i need help now im about to explode,anger managementdomestic violence,anxiety disorders,hi baton rougeim glad youre reaching out the first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours i do hear you minimizing your actions you say you dont hit her enough to cause harm but youre headed in the right direction i hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm youre causing isnt just superficial bruising the effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds please seek treatment for yourself immediatelyyou say you love your girlfriend do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partneryou have dangerous habits because you dont know how to manage your own emotional pain you can unlearn this and it doesnt mean youre a bad person sometimes however the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended for both of your sakes because too much damage has been donei know you dont want to lose her but you dont own her and you dont have the right to trap her in this because youre afraid of being alone right now she needs some space to figure out whats best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants this is potentially the first step to learning real respect honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort i wish you well
306,im feeling different towards my husband i feel i am growing from the relationship i have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five i just dont feel that connection anymore i feel nothing i dont know why or if im just being irrational,marriage,mood disorders,lacey im so glad you wrote thousands of people are having this same feeling right now im glad youre paying attention to it when you first meet someone there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection then what happens is because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we dont have to work hard to earn their love anymore that sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years long enough to procreate and keep the human race going and then it wears off a bit and you end up looking at each other thinking how come i dont feel the same anymoremostly not always and ill get to that in a minute all that this means is youve stopped doing all those loving things you used to do its as though you filled the car with gas youve run out of gas now and youre forgetting to put more inthe first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that youve cut back on act lovingly and you will likely regain those feelings talk to your partner about this its okay to say do you remember we used to do xy and z can we do that again can i get more of the foot rubs you used to give me ask for what you want instead of complaining what are your love languages what are your partners marriages need to be fed its that simple many things get in the waychildren jobs but mostly complacency get active with your loveokay now you might read this and think thats not whats happening thats a cue to talk to someone like a therapist about your feelings people do grow and change and sometimes relationships dont fit anymore but these are huge decisions not to be made lightly i wish you happiness

310,my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now throughout the entire first day that we met he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another that same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed the next two days were a repetition of the first day on the third night my mother finally caught us and i was kicked out of my house i left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple it was very hard for us his stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month after that it was a downward spiral we were constantly arguing about money food and our families we kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument after six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started one afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one he told me to let him leave or he would hit me he had once promised he would never touch me so i challenged him to do it he slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me i havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now i dont live with him i dont depend on him and we dont have children we both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly he always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i dont ever make the effort to try to be okay ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me i know he has to change that on his own i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned is there hope for a better future together,relationshipsdomestic violence,anxiety disorders,hi winters i learned a long time ago that i cant ever predict who will change and who wont i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change only you can decide how many years to give it i see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though what are you waiting foralthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change it doesnt work that way just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work you can only decide when youve paid too much i bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you hes not your only support
311,my girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because i said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers i have been trying to get her back but it isnt easy she is in her s and i am in my s she is the one i want for my life and this is killing me every day i cry and i am desperate for help,relationships,anxiety disorders,new york what would it mean about you if you got her back is that the only way you can like or forgive yourselfif she forgives you and takes you back your self respect doesnt need to rely on this working with her she simply doesnt want to be with you and every day that you refuse to honour her decision is another day that you hurt her all over again move on and heal perhaps with the help of a therapist
312,im a teenager my entire family needs family therapy and more than likely individual therapy my parents refuse to take action and im tired of it is there any way i can get out of this myself,family conflictlegal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,this sounds like a really tough situation  as a teenager you may be able to get counseling on your own without needing your parents consent under some circumstances  if your parents are refusing to consider counseling you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adult about finding some counseling resources  even without your parents help
313,after a domestic abuse situation i went to a therapist and then my husband went the therapist discussed her assessment of borderline personality disorder with me she then told my abuser the results of my tests,domestic violencelegal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,it sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission  there are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however  for example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that personif you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality you can always contact your states counseling regulatiory board  the board will then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action
314,i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration i hate it i dont know why but i just want it to be over i feel like crying i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it,intimacyhuman sexualityrelationships,mood disorders,although i am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area an initial question i have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing  if you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over  i would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time  until you figure out what is going on  i encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations if any  about being sexually active  do you fear pregnancy  are there problems in the relationship  are you afraid of the emotional intimacy another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way   when these types of traumatic events occur  people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma  such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with  if this is the case i strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues a final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration  if so i would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems  although pain can also be associated with emotional issues it is always good to rule out possible physical causes  i hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction  take care
315,my toddler defies everything i say and doesnt see me as authoritative so she says no about everything id like to hear some ways i can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time,anxietyparenting,anxiety disorders,thats a good question i would say learn to pick your battles what types of behaviorsituations can you let go of if you allow yourself to worry about the various areas in life that you cannot control you will find yourself stressed out and unable to manage everything know that toddlerhood comes with lots of nos tantrums noncompliance and a growing need for independence when your toddler does something that you dont approve of remain calm explain to himher the appropriate way to act and model it for himher remember to give your toddler praise when heshe does something good or acceptable be consistent and follow through with your instructions finally know that you are not alone parenting comes with its set of challenges but all you can do is your very best good luck to you

317,why am i so afraid of it i dont understand,anxiety,anxiety disorders,your fear is somewhat reasonable  no one wants to be raped and i imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel likedo you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would likeif this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fearis it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped  one general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe  the more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar probably your fear will decreasethe other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physicallyin families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generationits possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own sufferingthe good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden
318,i have no idea what happened i go places and do things but still feel lonely i honestly have no friends and i am always the one texting people and bothering people i feel invisible like someone that no one wants to be around,intimacysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,a lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situationsis it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your lifeif yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choiceat the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you firstalso most relationships are not forever  is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity

321,whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting i say mean things to let my anger out whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful i hurt the ones i love with my words i want to be better for myself and them,anger managementrelationshipssocial relationships,anxiety disorders,"taking accountability for your actions and seeking help is an excellent first step i wonder where the anger is coming from learning what is at
the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some
relief in itself i would also suggest doing some selfexploration and see a
therapist for individual sessions in order to gain a clearer insight as to what
the cause is there are also several actions you can take on your own to help
control your anger and communicate more effectively here is what i would recommend
you try
take time outs when you feel yourself becoming upset excuse yourself and
take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of
action or redirect your thoughts all together often when we become
angry it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotions get in
the way 
do deep breathing exercises close your eyes breathe in slowly to the
count of  breathe out even slower to the count of  practice this for about
 minutes  times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this
time once it becomes routine for you it will be easier to apply during
situations in which you are angry or upset
change negative thought patterns try and recall or be aware of your
thoughts particularly when you are feeling angry what are these thoughts
telling you are they valid or logical is there factual evidence to support
the negative thoughts often the answer is no learn to stop the
negative thoughts and replace them with logical and more positive
ones 
communicate effectively as a speaker you want to use i
statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming himher
by using you statements for example you might say something such
as i feel sad when you dont come home at a decent hour and i dont get
to spend time with you versus you always stay out late and dont
even care about me the speaker should also avoid using black and white
language such as always never etc as the listener you want to validate what
you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening you will also want
to be responsive and offer fair solutions
i wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes
from"
322,i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,traumafamily conflict,mood disorders,i can imagine how incredibly difficult this must be for you having past traumatic experiences creap up on you without warning can be very scary and stressful you may be suffering from symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder getting evaluated by a professional would be a good step to take next by seeking treatment and having a therapist who you trust and can connect with you will gain the ability to think about your experiences without it significantly interfering with your daily functioning a therapist can also help you to develop new coping stragies to be used during recall of these experiences and help you to adopt healthy thought patterns i would also recommend that you seek support from loved ones sometimes just talking about your experiences and associated feelings will alleviate some of the emotional troubles you are suffering from lastly you may find meditation or mindfulness work to be of great benefit having the ability to live in the present moment should reduce the effects of your traumatic experiences interfering with recalling your past or looking forward to your future i wish you all the best
323,i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,traumafamily conflict,mood disorders,hi new york theres no way to keep your past from affecting your present and future because its a huge part of who we are the good news is though that the effect doesnt have to be negative im met many people who have horrific pasts and it helps them know confidently every day what kind of person they want to be and what kind of world they want to live in and it helps them make really great decisions you can accept your past integrate your traumas and move forward in a very different way if you see negative ways in which your past affects you and this is also common you are wise to seek professional help without knowing more its impossible to give you a lot of direction here basically our past creates emotional bruises that are touch on and triggered by present situations but our reactions are often about more than just the present moment i think you know thati wish you the best as you sort it out
324,over the course of a few days my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues after she thought things through she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me she instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family at that point she said our marriage was over now over the course of the last few days she has taken a friendship from a coworker she insists there is nothing more than friends but she has spent all her free time with him,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,hi portlandthis must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend i get how upsetting this isif i was your therapist id want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening be careful not to jump to conclusions sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage she may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said so its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisisshes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist but its not your place to tell her to do this or its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her  right now its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate if shes asking for that we cant trap people in a marriage if she needs separation or distance then its respectful to give her thatthat doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now i would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what you want whether its to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of time i cant predict what will happen here but you can find out what the best path for you is i wish you the best
325,my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,parenting,anxiety disorders,hi dillonim from canada so i dont know the laws in your state it depends on that a good deal perhaps in my opinion a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe even if it is supervised if the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent then this should be honoured unfortunately the laws dont always uphold a parents right to do what is best for their child i recommend you see a lawyer who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreementsif you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy that is a separate question or is she already in therapy a family therapist will typically meet with you alone first in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child it isnt always appropriate
326,my partner seems to always get depressed over the fact that his kids have to see and go through the divorce process its especially when the mother of his kids keeps making him feel bad and using the kids as an excuse to get back at him i feel like just telling him to go back with his family and forget about me,relationships,anxiety disorders,hold on sanger you know i meet with a lot of people who are so sick of the crap that their ex puts them through in the divorce process that yes they wonder if its best to go back i dont think soif your ex is using the children to manipulate or is generally controlling the separation process thats confirmation that getting out was the right decisionyour partner feels powerless to change the current situation of course he does because there are many things that are beyond his control his exs behaviours for one accept the powerlessness lean into it its okay because there are many things he does have power over and thats where he can focus he has the power to give his children a happy dad thats huge thats why he left id guess i bet the main barrier to him being happy is the guilt he feels thats his exs voicethats what she wants him to feelto give into that is letting her win ending a marriage in order to be happy is his right he has not intentionally harmed his children hopefully hes aware that the separation has  affected them and hes working to create peace and balance in their lives but hes can let go of the shame she wants him to feel its crippling himhe has the power to separate emotionally from his ex hes not doing that when he lets her words control his emotions hes still reacting to her he hasnt completely left yeta good therapist can help your partner regulate his emotions combat shame create emotional distance from his ex and erect proper boundaries he needs your support in moving forwards not going backwards i wish you the best

328,i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,traumafamily conflict,mood disorders,sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painfuleveryone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by livingall of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of othersthe best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationshipsif you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of originthis realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situationsthis type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parentsexpect slow progress and expect more than a few tearsif it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourselfsending lots of good luck
329,my boyfriend recently got a kitty i hate cats in general and he knows it it grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat i want to throw out the cat i feel very jealous,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,sorry for you and sorry for the cat because youre each in a tense positionwhat was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with youif you dont already know his answer then find out  doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you  does he expect you to accept without question whatever he does  does he care about your views  does a cat have some deep meaning for him that having one is essential to his life and he never told you soplease dont be mean to the cat  its not the cats fault for being in your boyfriends carethere are plenty of other cats on this earth so throwing out the cat will not solve anything between you and your boyfriendwho knows your boyfriend may come back home with three more catsstart with a conversation about your feelings and his interest in your feelings
330,my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,parenting,anxiety disorders,has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitationor is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughterif no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up no one has even asked where she is why she isnt present then i dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter than the father is willing to make for seeing herif your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or notthe one move id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated
331,whenever i run into a situation that makes me upset or angry i tend to start cursing and badly offending the person i am confronting i say mean things to let my anger out whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship i lash out not just them but at my boyfriend i feel like i keep causing drama due to my personality i want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful i hurt the ones i love with my words i want to be better for myself and them,anger managementrelationshipssocial relationships,anxiety disorders,hi californiaim happy to hear you want to get a hold of this problem relationships dont tend to last when we treat people poorly it is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort i would highly suggest working with a therapist and i will give you a few things to think about in the interimsometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair but many times anger is a secondary emotion and its simply there to protect us from other more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important perhaps you feel powerless or unloved or unimportant it may take some time before you recognise this emotion once you do you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion where did it originate at what age did you feel too much of that feelingso much so that you cant stand it even in tiny amountsyou will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling they are typically incorrect thoughts like no one lifes me or people will always hurt me fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that arent likelyyour habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of selfworth and you dont believe people will love youso you hurt them to keep them at a distance this happens in a subconscious level do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you didnt believe in your worth so its backwards really because you think youre getting mad at people who piss you off but youre really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourselfin addition to this work you can start to purposely treat people more kindly find out what respect is make amends and  resolve to spreading peace it might sound too simple but if you act as though youre a person of peace you will start to feel more peacefulbut i hope you do contact a therapist it will take time and support to reach your goal
332,my son stole my debit card and lied about it its not the first time he has lied i dont know what to do anymore i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong i have grounded him but nothing works what should i do,parenting,anxiety disorders,hi enid you sound like a sensitive parent i like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong there is some key information here i dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but ill give you my thoughtsi see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world in order to accomplish that many of them test limits what can i get away with is a question they have to find the answer to if a child knows the rules theyre much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits so part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying not all kids steal but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point its a normal behaviour and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find out stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and im not surprised he lied about it if you absolutely know that he took it its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesnt do it again the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible the behaviour stealing was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea its funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we dont want people to know our mistakes its a dilemma if you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day that gives him incentive to come to you with truth it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty put a cookie on the counter tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day then ask them later if they took the cookie youre making honesty fun kids love games basically theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative if this is the first serious offence for your son dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns if its a pattern thats different and you may want the input of a therapist
333,i was hanging out with my close guy friend we started kissing but afterwards he said that we should just stay friends because he doesnt want to ruin anything we both just got out of relationships his was very sexual im not a sexual person and he knows that i want to be with him but im not ready for another relationship and i dont know if he ever will want to be more than friends,relationships,anxiety disorders,given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfactionsuddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persons energy stay focused on what you know about yourself which is that youre not ready for another relationshipfrom what you describe about your friend similar to you he does not feel ready for a new relationshipif and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive then youll be in a position to find out either by approaching your friend as a potential partner or by asking your question of his interest in youwho knowsit is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship approach you and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become accept his offergood luck with step one becoming familiar with your new state of single hood and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship
334,its been almost a year since my exboyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times i had found out about a month before but i hadnt told him i knew because i didnt want us to break up i used to have very low selfesteem and i think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic my father cheated on my mother when i was little i wonder if this pain has to do with that my exboyfriend and i were only dating for five months but i still cant get over this betrayal im not sure what to feel to get over it forgiveness hate he helped me financially after our break up by lending me  so im grateful for that i still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although were not even talking anymore we follow each other on instagram and thats it i feel like i still need his validation this is haunting me day and night i want to focus on my new relationship and goals but i keep obsessing over this and keep checking my exboyfriends instagram and facebook i feel so bad and keep having nightmares,traumaselfesteemrelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,the dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationshipcontinue developing some points youve written herethat you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her very likely set a standard in your inner self to expect similar circumstances in your relationship lifethis is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us  what we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as normal no matter how bad it actually isafter all children dont have the ability to separate that what their own parents do is wrong compared with the rest of our cultureit is natural to long for a relationshipwhat you have the chance to do now is distinguish the reasons for your longingis it to attach to someone who has hurt you hasnt shown you any understanding of having hurt you and whose validation even if he says validating words has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm usif youre able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime
335,i just had a newborn when i brought him home my mom told me to leave now im in a womens home i dont see my boyfriend that often because he works the womens place is helping me find an apartment so i can go back to work and get child care,depressionfamily conflict,mood disorders,congrats on the birth of your sonwas your moms request for you to leave her house one which she asked awhile ago or was this her greeting when you walked in the doormy question is whether your mom had some changed circumstance in her life whether she and you discussed living arrangements prior to your sons birth or whether nothing was talked about you assumed youd be living with her she assumed you wouldnt and the two of you didnt speak to one another about any of thisdepending on the answers there may be clues as to handling future expectations of others especially your momfrom what you write the womens home is supportive of your basic daily living needs   it is good news that the people who run this home know and offer community resourcesin your interactions with the staff of the womens home ask all the questions necessary so youll have a clear understanding of the apartment lease anything at all that is on your mind about becoming employed and finding childcarethe point is to have all the major steps youre about to start addressedthis way youll be minimizing the possibility of any sudden bad news by the womens home told to yousending lots of good luck
336,i have been married for  years he and i both cheated i hid my cheating for  years over that time i let life stress me out i became depressed when i finally woke up he felt i had pushed him out,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,do you both want to fix the marriagethe relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too will have one person who does all the changingthis dynamic itself creates problems of its ownabout your husband telling you he feels pushed out did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like thisall you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt likeif he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you is okbecause affairs create mistrust between two people the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each others trusttalking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other how you each are feeling what matters to you is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriages future
337,my exboyfriend boyfriend and i lived together he had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her one was an abortion another was a miscarriage and then she had the third baby they are not together but he continues to contact me and wants me back he has nothing to offer me,relationshipsrelationship dissolution intimacy,mood disorders,hi atticathis is a question i think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them in your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you for some people honestly its a game to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you if you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour remind yourself why you dont want to be with them i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me thats great selftalkbut lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this sometimes its because we still hope they will change maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days the problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less so what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of people do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life this is a normal but not a healthy thought its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes you deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused if you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better it will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursdraw a line their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance
338,i was never like this recently this year my first year of high school i started getting emotional for no reason,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,hello vancouver its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes the small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke if theres anger there look underneath that is it powerlessness worthlessness hurt shame  then ask yourself when in your life youve experienced too much of that feeling as a child maybe but not necessarily thats the first step and combined with empathy compassion and selfesteem youre starting to build what i call an emotional air conditioner a good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily i wish you the best
339,i have a really bad temper i get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day i dont mean to be that way but i cant help it,anger management,anxiety disorders,a lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves   a surface situation like a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by tuesday and when that particular tuesday comes the store doesnt have what they told you they would and you are furiousthe fury may have more with many times before in your life having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever itif at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life the relationship didnt allow for honest expression of all your emotions youd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearlywithout practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone eventually the person possibly you learned to contain and contain your emotionsit is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately are muting hurt feelings that youve understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history to not talk aboutas a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear  are really the underlying source of your upseti hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions
340,about a month ago i went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his exgirlfriend that he was dating before me he gave her a promise ring when they were together and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room i found many things on his phone but that broke my heart the most he deleted all the messages but two i cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that it really kills me and i cant stop thinking about it,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,your sense of hurt is very understandabledo you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phonesi ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationshipprobably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the otherwith this new level of clarity his  past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little
341,i noticed lately that ive been thinking a lot about death i dont want to die and im not suicidal i just think about what would happen if i died or if someone i loved died i imagine how sad everyone i know would be i know it isnt worth it and i definitely want to live and have a future i just think about it when im driving i sometimes imagine what would happen if i just let go of the wheel and kept going,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,ill respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving youll end up quite seriously hurt at the very least   it is fine to play in your mind with what ifs   people who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositionsif you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on deathsince you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in youplay around with your idea as to why youd consider how people will feel about you if youre not in their livesthis may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others
342,ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,relationshipsbehavioral changeanxiety,anxiety disorders,hi new jerseyyou talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosisanxiety and the moving in together thats a loti love how you recognise that you been questioning everything i think anxietys got its toe in the door and its pushing you around wanting some power over you fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that its best to either pull away or fight but letting anxiety control how you see your relationship isnt the answer here i think you know that alreadyyou must have moved in with him for a reason and its appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriendwhen youre in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change i suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear
343,my husband and i have been together for seven years now i will be honest i have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff i recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because i was afraid to tell him what happened ever since then he gives me the cold shoulder he gets so mad and ignores me for days hes really verbally and emotionally abusive he tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names should we call it quits im tired of crying but we have a toddler together,marriagedomestic violence,mood disorders,hi texas thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask should we call it quits we i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together the way your husband treats you is not your fault texas your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you the problem is not your lying the problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trusttheres an analogy that i sometimes use i dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but its powerful either way so i will tell it to youif you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die if you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying it has lost its strength its called learned helplessness when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you you have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child in my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse this is a complex picture and if you were my client i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child i sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist i wish you the best
344,im depressed i have been for years i hide it from everyone because im scared of the reactions ill get last time i tried telling my parents it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed im a legal adult calling me ungrateful and telling me that if i cant handle things now its only going to get worse in the future which is turning out to be true its exhausting pretending to be okay and i dont know how much longer i can try im just really tired and sadly i cant afford the help i need on my own,family conflictdepression,mood disorders,hi georgia theres a really good lesson here people tell us things and we tend to think thats the truthbut its not ill do some translating for youyoure so ungrateful means i need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel im a good parentyoure too young to be depressed means i dont want to deal with your mental health issues right now ill pretend its not happening so i dont have to face my fear and shameits only going to get worse just means i dont know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sakeyour parents are being unsupportive not because youre not suffering but because this is all theyre capable of right now they are not where you will find the support you need so keep looking for it in other places its out there if might be an aunt or a friend or a friends aunt it might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor keep looking for someone who will hear you i hope you dont ever give up 
345,i was texting a guy who wasnt my boyfriend and my boyfriend found out we work together so he went to work and told everyone i was cheating on him i moved out of the house there have been previous problems and i feel like im usually the issue here in order for us to move on he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesnt want me to do anymore im wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if i should walk away,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi dallas while i think its healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds onesided and rigid will you have a list too there are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forwarddoes he decide when you move in and out your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you dont have a voice in this relationship do you have a voice if you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice if you cant hear your own voice maybe its time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and wantno relationship is all good or all bad wouldnt that make it easy relationships dont come with billboards that tell us what to do they dont come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor you have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you youre too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly a therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is
346,i am on my own with my daughter i am so worried and stressed about her,parentingdepressionbehavioral changestress,mood disorders,your instinct to help your daughter is naturalhow you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing heralso her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describeif you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit herif your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselorstarting therapy without willingness to do so is risky  the person may feel resentful enough to not participate   and sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapyfamily counseling regardless of your daughters age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situationsalso if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response
347,i dont know how to have emotions i never had any from my birth being human i think of myself as a monster i enjoy pain i cut myself for my climax during sex i think most of the time i lie even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth i was in rehabilitation for four year i have made love with both men and women but it made no impact in my emotions the books that i enjoy reading hp lovecraft and edgar allen poe i go hunting every saturday i feel powerful i dont enjoy the killing of the creature but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature,depressionselfesteem,mood disorders,im not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions from what you write the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel  little kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth  this is information someone told you or was part of your family systempossibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yourssimilarly your comparison of being human means being monster like is not an obvious connection  besides monsters are an idea they arent real  they embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species  again i wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you area way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belongif on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotionsif someone buys you a birthday present be aware of how you feel  keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions
348,ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,relationshipsbehavioral changeanxiety,anxiety disorders,how is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around himhas he told you that hes noticed changes in youthe good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person  doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship  given that the two of you recently moved in together it is natural for new dynamics feelings and expectations to arise  it just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of youpsychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills  very often just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually areanxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressedit is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters   be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you   youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations  keep the label of being disordered aside  psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives
349,my motherinlaw is mentally ill she has been for most of her life she cuts herself she has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about  years she has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself she has had multiple shock therapy treatments and shes on enough medication to take down an elephant her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late s she doesnt even have custody of herself she hasnt asked yet but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child how do i go about saying no without creating an issue,family conflictparentingmarriage,mood disorders,hi fontanathanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question it seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response i like your healthy boundaries and ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her first she hasnt asked yet and you dont know that she will right now you can pleasantly ignore her hints theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them theyre more likely to go away you can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if shes offended that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations so the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry you might never have to face that moment but i understand that you want to be preparedas her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come is he willing to do this but if you are comfortable and if youre the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it wont happen and i would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later no need to apologize or hum and hawwe love that you want to be around junior and we definitely want you in hisher life try to leave out the but here youre not in a healthy place and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your ownif she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries id let her know that its not negotiable that you understand if shes disappointed but youre not open to discussing the issue really theres nothing to discuss learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life i wish you the best

362,"im a young adult woman and i have trouble finding my true identity being at home this all started when i had a boyfriend about  months ago my boyfriend and i were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts at the time i was pretty religious but i let this happen i dont know why i felt kind of guilty but mostly because i know my parents wouldnt like it my parents are very religioustheyre christians we did things every time hed come over to my house we didnt have anything to do at our house so we would get tempted to do things when wed watch movies by ourselves

one day my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages as soon as my dad found this out he told my mom they were both aggravated they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants they said he wanted me for sex and hes not a christian i took their advice and broke up with him once we broke up for about a month i decided to get back together with him a little after school started my parents found out eventually and i decided to not listen this time i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him hows hes not the right one for me and god totally forbids him i would kind of try to break up with him and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents theyre always yelling at me about how i shouldnt date this boy i felt too old to listen to them now im kind of just stuck is the real me religious have i been brainwashed by him i dont talk to my parents anymore about him and my parents think im deceiving because of it they threatened me that if im still with him i cant do track and they wont support me theyve also called me slut and now they called me basically a devil worshipper they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents im actually very happy with him they also say im living a separate life at home than i am at school they say they want whats best for me and love me because they adopted me",relationshipshuman sexualityfamily conflictspirituality,anxiety disorders,what a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you i would say the first thing you want to do is if you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward you unfortunately will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents it always helps to try and see things from another angle you might want to for example try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively are you living with your parents and do they support you if so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that best of luck to you

364,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,mood disorders,hi ohio i totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot thats a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce ill get you startedyou feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident is it triggering some old shame unfortunately a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids it doesnt work when was the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame as in im bad or im worthless is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that wasnt your fault sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma if so picture yourself at that age can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them isnt their fault can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them thats your first goalto go to the source of the shame and heal that childs wound with compassion what happens to children is never their fault and fault is a pretty useless concept anywayonce you take the layers of old im bad shame off the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame here are some things you can say to yourselfevery dayim human and thats okay i dont have to be perfecti can have compassion for my mistakesi can feel proud that im facing my mistake and making things righti deserve forgiveness and compassion and i have that for other people tootheres no purpose to holding on to shamei can learn from my mistakes and move forwardeveryone makes mistakesother people dont want me to carry this shame aroundi dont need shame to remind me not to do it again ive figured that outshame tries to convince you that you need to carry it around in order to prevent further mistakes poppycock  youve learned your lesson now you can move forward to other mistakes sorrybut youre human and youll keeping making hopefully different glorious mistakes embrace the learning lean into the experiences of life its all juicy stuff and youre in good company were all in the same position of being mortal
365,how can i know if im just being paranoid,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi texasoh thats a powerful idea isnt it it burrows into your head lets figure this out first has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them have they cheated before if not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence if its a yes then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that youre hiding something i need openness if they havent cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on what is the specific thing thats triggering your fears when you have your data recorded read onthe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fearpeople cheat for their own reasons not because were not interesting this may be true if what you wrote down is they didnt really do anything wrongthere is no evidence im just scared and suspicious thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened i can trustif what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or youre having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions trust your gut but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheatingits evidence of something ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptionsthe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you i hope that helps

367,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,addictionsubstance abuse,mood disorders,this relationship with your step dad sounds very challenging it is hard to to be told over and over again how not good enough we are let me offer you this frequently when we say harsh mean nasty things to others we are simply projecting our own thoughts about ourself i am not advocating that this is ok it seems like your stepdad could also use some support you get to make your own empowered choice around this this is your life and if you find yourself in a situation that does not suit you make a change
368,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,addictionsubstance abuse,mood disorders,anyone who wants to change their life path eventually will be successful in this  how to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional painthe basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed  almost always addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored humiliated shamed invisible nothing very pleasant since a very young age usually starting around  monthsmost often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their familywith no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outletso people mask and numb by substances whether this is food chocolate work alcohol weedtherapy that is humanistic based is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis orientedif youd like getting serious about knowing who you are including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years you can do thisonce you have a stronger selfrespect and awareness you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people  harming oneself is the opposite of selfrespectalso about your diagnosis it may not be true at all  the us healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugssee if you can find a therapist who is independent minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something wrongthis simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first placegood luck
369,my boyfriend is seeking therapy he is in his s and has some childhood issues he has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them,relationshipstrauma,mood disorders,probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsdont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured  a relatively qualified therapist would never make this callpsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families  you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenchildhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeif the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting

371,"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this a while back  years ago i asked him to stop drinking so much and he agreed i caught him one night drinking behind my back i confronted him and he lied but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again lately my husband has been drinking on and off but i noticed it was every single night i didnt like this for our new years resolution we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption he was on boardno more drinking every night
the other night i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing it took a couple of days but tonight i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing but i couldnt wait i asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and i cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking he slurred a bit and said no i asked if he had been drinking but he snapped and said no i went into our room to sleep leaving him on the couch 
im not sure if im overreacting or not i just feel like im so honest with him about everything and i expect the same honesty he is a good husband in every other regard",addictionmarriageintimacy,mood disorders,hi los angelesso your husband is giving you mixed messages he says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it his behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent it sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partner your husbands lying is sending a message i get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it underneath that maybe its i want to stop but im ashamed that i cant and i dont want you to see my failures ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout pushbackbacklash  how does his drinking affect you thats where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out asking if hes been drinking seems confusing youve mentioned snoring which i guess is a legitimate complaint if hes passing out thats a legitimate complaint when he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you all of these things are legitimate concerns and id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers my guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress so he checks out with alcohol and it also helps him avoid your relationship but the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you then more you chase him with your questionstheres a conversation that would be helpful here  it sounds like ive tried to support you in your drinking less and its not working what are your goals for alcohol and how can i support you in that more effectively id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking but focusing on the things that affect you what concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement can we get the alcohol out of the house is he willing to seek treatment lay your expectations out really clearly i wont count your beers but i cant tolerate lying you have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers or is it something else what do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage what does he need does he let you know what isnt okay with him he might have trouble saying these things the drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage a qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart understanding it and changing the way you relate to each other
372,i am divorced and happily remarried our blended family of children are in their s my youngest age  continues to call me crazy and favors her dad he was abusive to me and i left with injuries he never wanted kids and i did he paid child support only through forced wage earners now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past  years as a single mom i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core im not sure how to handle this,parentingrelationship dissolution family conflict,mood disorders,hi arkansas your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you its a form of woman abuse and child abuse hes likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and hes not considering how its affecting the kids ive seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent in some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless its your exs job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it while you cant change his behaviours and i think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids for your children you can refuse to enter into the war hes setting up hes trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you dont have to fall for this if you run around screaming hes lying it only makes you look more crazy try to stay calm and dont put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is one day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent they see who their dad is already id bet but they dont know how to cope with that if hes the only one fighting a war youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict dont engage on his level dont blame your children completely although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it they are acting out their fathers agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them you get the worst because they trust your love but you can still have boundaries letting them abuse you isnt the answer but have compassion for their position this picture isnt their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choicesreassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are you dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful it may take a while you cant rush it but they will see you for who you are your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on id recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded good luck

374,ive been having this ongoing problem for most of my life now i am a young adult and right now driving and even being a passenger gives me terrible panic attacks and anxiety i cant ride in the backseat or the front seat with the safety belt on i have to lean the seat back a bit because the pressure on my back terrifies me i miss so many opportunities to go places with friends and family because of my fears of having a panic attack my family offers little to no support they think its fake or all in my head it makes me feel guilty and at times depressed to the point where id rather never wake up anymore i am not selfharming i just feel meaningless this constant fear has taken over my thoughts and my life i was such a happy person i want my life back i want to travel with my friends and family again but i dont know how ive almost given up hope on getting better and just accepting the fact that ill live with this anxiety forever,anxietydepressionselfesteem,anxiety disorders,not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itselfhow about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problemare any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passengermaybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacksif no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this timeits possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourselfif no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyones wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their supportbe realistic in what youre able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional needthinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone  eventually youll stabilize within yourself and know that all youre asking for is some support for having a tough time hopefully the others will be more responsive to youif they dont you still know that youre being reasonable for what youd like

381,a girl and i were madly in love we dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together she moved away for school and we attempted a long distance relationship we eventually broke up its been a year now and i still havent lost my feelings for her i still love her the same way i did ive suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else its damaging me and my life,relationship dissolution depressionsocial relationships,mood disorders,hi boise im sorry that youve lost this love the fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time its different nowyoure not together anymore but you cant accept this right good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life youve been grieving for longer than you were together oh but really youve not been grievingyoure stuck still loving her instead of moving forward unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache lets look at some possible blocks to moving forwardit could be that theres something unfinished for you maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way if this is the case you have two choices right you can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go if you reach out theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send itit might be worth the risk use the next paragraph to help you decide do you know how she feels how did it end did she end it was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didnt work sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs if shes asked for distance you would do well to honour thata key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck write it down what bad thing can happen if you let it go or if i move forward that will mean  keep goingwhat would be the worst part of that  this kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placeit is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future as in if this person doesnt love me then im unlovable or no one will ever love me as much as she did so your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future can you find another way to reject that message try saying these things to yourselfi know she loved me there is evidence of thati was a good partner there is evidence of thatits part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardi can do this and learn from itmany people like methats how i know im lovableits normal to feel sad im grieving a lost lovei want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrori know more love awaits me if i can get fear out of the wayif this person loved me others can too but not if im clinging to some old memorythese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you i wish you well
382,i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present,social relationships,anxiety disorders,hi chapel hill i like your goal research is telling us more and more that one of the most important keys to happiness is having healthy relationships if we feel successful in that area it can give us the confidence and hope to tackle anything life throws at usthere are personal barriers we all have to having healthy relationships its our stuff our baggage not a steam trunk rightyou have a cute little gucci bag you hint that people may have hurt you in the past maybe fear says stay awayhold onto resentment or you will be hurt again resentment or simply focusing on the past is certainly a barrier to improving any relationship learning to forgive ourselves and others is so important and rememberforgiveness isnt about saying something was okay it only means it happened i cant change that and i dont want to carry it anger hurt resentment around anymore so i let it go orsometimes fear tells us that people wont accept us this keeps us isolated for sure but really all fear wants is power over us fear is a trickster it tells us that if we let go of the past we will be rejected or hurt it says im trying to protect you but what it really wants is to paralyze and isolate us all so it can feel powerful once you pull the sheeps clothing off of fear you can see that it doesnt help you at allonce you see where your personal barriers are and you start to refute those thoughts in your mind you can begin to build new ideas about yourself and other people that are based on compassion instead of fear everyone deserves forgiveness and compassionno one deserves to be judged by their worst momentsif i look in the rearview mirror i cant move forwardwe are all beautifully imperfecti cant change the past but i have the power to make the future goodi wish you the best on your journey
383,my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi rockford while no relationship is perfect and its natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we dont have to smother each other with attention anymore your situation sounds like something different he has no time for me yet you dont fight hmmmis it that you dont fight because you dont bring up whats bothering you are you avoiding conflict many people do what do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away as an engaged couple now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real or maybe you have spoken to him about it if so what happens does he listen and help you understand him better or does he avoid and reassure youor maybe dismiss you this is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together he says leave me alone thats a pretty bold statement about what he wants he doesnt seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is and how close you want to be plus i have to say those words sound more like what a closedoff fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be giving him the benefit of the doubt it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change but if this is true he needs to tell you that so you can understand so i suggest that the fact that when youre together youre okay is perhaps not the best barometer for how youre doing as a couple listen to your gut i encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are this may get rockier before it gets better but until you face whats not working you wont know who you truly are as a couple  when youre engaged its a really cool time to see a therapist tooto get some conflict resolution skills down before youre a married couple

393,i have been married for ten years my husband is  years my senior we have a young daughter ever since she was born my husband has shut down we have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me ive told him how i feel for years and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy but i still have to literally beg for sex and affection my selfesteem is gone and i feel so alone he has stranded me he uses his passiveaggressive ways and ignores every comment i make he refuses to talk to me in detail,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi smyrnayour husband is avoiding dealing with this problem i understand how lonely you must feel not only sexually but emotionally toofrom what you describe it seems that he wants to be there for you but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue my hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you but i think he does have something to sayyour husband is  years older and youve been together for ten yearsthat puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormonerelated low sex drive as they age its possible that your husband is bewildered angry grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this he may feel like hes letting you down and hes scared it will get worse so hes sticking his head in the sand of course that doesnt help does itthe worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame eventually you stop chasing him and you drift further apart its a bit of a conundrumhow to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities maybe lower your expectations for a bit your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared and that hes not rejecting youjust protecting himselfi would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like sweetheart we both know that somethings not right here i think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better but can we agree that its not i need you to either talk to me about whats happening or please go see a doctor what i need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us either of those things would show me thatin the end you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way if he does neither then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage i wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help just a thought

395,i constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff its constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious i dont sleep because im thinking about something i can get rid of i dont know why i do it i started years ago when i lived with my dad then i stopped when i moved in with my mom years later it has started again,anxietybehavioral change,anxiety disorders,since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parentplay in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this  are you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things  im only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarilyanxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives  so pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years   possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parentbasically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released
396,the sounds of eating and breathing gives me headachesmostly mouth breathing and snoring it makes me angry and i want to solve it myself,anger management,anxiety disorders,probably good to know in what type of situations you are in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoringif youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchenbasically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling themdepending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds or not willing to change or not has a good deal to do with next stepsi dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the headone path i dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered or dismissing your own sensitivity someoneyour needs matter
397,im a teenage girl i dont know if im straight bisexual or gay ive been straight all my life but a sudden rush of questions have come over me and i dont know anymore,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,hi brentwood while our society tends to want to put us into categoriesslotswhen it comes to sexuality because this is nice and neat and convenientmany people find that they dont fit perfectly into one or the other all you have to do is exactly what youre doing be aware of yourself and allow yourself to explore these thoughts and emotions both alone and in connection with a safe partner the people who love you will continue to love you as you sort through this you can resist the temptation to please others by giving yourself a label we are attracted to and fall in love with peopleand we cant always predict what gender they might be i love how open you are to discovering yourself keep on that track 
398,i have been dating my boyfriend for a month and we want a baby we dont work or drive and we havent talked to our parents what should we do,relationships,anxiety disorders,hi athens when a teenager wants to have a baby its usually for a specific and not healthy reason do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship it doesnt work that way do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply babies dont give to us we give endlessly to them i urge you to talk to someone you trust about why you want to speed up your life by being a parent before you are fully grown emotionally a relationship that is one month old is not stable enough to support a change like this youre only starting to get to know each other i wish you well and hope you talk to someone
399,recently i had a close call after delivering my second child blood clot followed by internal bleeding and several blood transfusions it was a close call i am currently undergoing medical treatment because of the event and i am constantly afraid the whole ordeal will happen again i have never really had anxiety in the past but i find now that it consumes my every day and night with two beautiful children to raise i am most terrified of not being able to raise and protect them,traumaanxiety,anxiety disorders,hi meriden its natural that after a serious scare like that you would have some anxiety and fear this fear is helpful to some extent because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health you can say thanks very much to fear for trying to protect you and then you can take steps to reduce it right now fear is working overtime and stealing your quality of life you can work to put it into perspectivei invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you dont need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be imagine that fear is in front of you its saying hey you need me if i wasnt keeping you alert you would be very ill fear doesnt trust you to take care of yourself what is the evidence you are caring for yourself and doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence what is the evidence that this wont likely happen again it was specifically connected to the stress of labour right what is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur what is the evidence that you are healing what is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence what is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you not help you how many hours of your life do you want to hand over to fearfear is trying to keep you safe but you can turn the volume down by talking to yourself about all these things i wish you well
400,my brother just broke up with his girlfriend while they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us how should we approach the situation is she doing the right thing for her child,parenting,anxiety disorders,hi tampa i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact in my book the more people loving a child the better but ultimately she has the right to make these decisions to oppose her wont likely do any good you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well
401,im a teenage girl i dont know if im straight bisexual or gay ive been straight all my life but a sudden rush of questions have come over me and i dont know anymore,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,being open minded about the type of sexual connection which feels true and real is a solid starting pointhaving questions is a very valuable way of more clearly defining your sexualitywrite one or two of your questions if youd like a more specific focus to your general search about your sexual preference

411,i love him so much and i dont know what to do,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi savannah this is a pretty common issue one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving yet their partner doesnt feel loved theres a great book the five love languages by gary chapman he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we dont necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner you might feel that by going out to work and earn money youre being loving but if your partners main love language is quality time youre not hitting that bulls eye because youre not home the five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch i recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partners language a bit better you may never be fluent but you can get better the most important part is to understand each other better and to know that theres nothing wrong with either of you youre just speaking different languages you can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved i bet he just needs you to speak his language  
412,he owns his own business sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me we have a son together and i get to stay home with him he says i complain too much about what hes doing weve been together a year and a half i got pregnant after being together for a month we moved in together when i had my son in july everything was great and then he started the staying out he then started not spending time with either of us i just dont know if im doing something wrong weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi oklahoma listen to him when he says this is how he is your boyfriends behaviours are about him not you at the start of a relationship its easy to be loving and attentive but it takes years to really get to know someone deeply with time people reveal who they arefor some reason he is giving himself permission to detach from you and your son this could be for several reasons he may be avoiding intimacy and connection he may be avoiding commitment he may fear he isnt enough or and there is evidence of this one he may have misogynist attitudes about male privilege that interfere with his ability to be the kind of supportive and respectful partner that you need it seems that youve addressed this problem with him and told him what you need good for you his response seems dismissive though and this isnt a good sign any problem can be worked through if you have two people who care about respect and listen to each other it seems this basic foundation is missing herei suggest a therapist might be able to help you sort out where to go from here i wish you the best 
413,ive been going through a rough time lately i been into nothing but women ive never thought about men until a week ago im very upset and depressed about this its not normal to me i looked at gay porn more than once to prove that im not gay i get the same results each time and i feel disgust this is tough on me im scared that i looked too many times i keep thinking about it and shake all the time,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,hi brookfield it can be unsettling when we feel something as fundamental as our sexual orientation shifting i like that youre honest enough with yourself to say im struggling with this to accept that there is a question is a brave place to be andit doesnt necessarily mean youre gayunfortunately we live in a culture that wants to put people in slotsmale or female straight or gaywe tend to not like those grey areas so much as a culture the truth is that if we grew up in a society where there wasnt this categorizationif we felt free to explore and grow sexually we might be surprised at who we are attracted to you dont have to put yourself in a slot our sexual preferences are more fluid than we think and it can change over timewe also live in a culture where there is prejudice against homosexuality or differentness in general the wish to not be gay can be powerful many people who are gay spend years believing they were heteroxualfighting against repressing  or ignoring their gay thoughts this is needless pain if you are gay there is no shame in that and you can still have a glorious life filled with love and passionhaving said all thatjust because you have thoughts about men or get turned on by gay porm doesnt mean youre gay many heterosexual people have thoughts and fantasies about the same sex its arousing because its naughtywere curious about the forbidden or were just curious becoming aroused by gay porn is normal for many heterosexual men sexual orientation isnt just about sex either a different gauge of who you are sexually can be found in your emotions towards men or women are you drawn into emotional connections with men more than women who do you feel the urge to explore and be close toexploring your sexuality through being open to different experiences can help too how does it feel to kiss a man to touch a man as compared with a womansometimes this feels like such a big and forbidden step that its a barrier to discovering ourselves we dont want to open that door i wish you well as you do exactly what you are supposed to be doingexploring and discovering yourself its an exciting journey and you might want to find a trusted person to talk more about this with

415,ive been going through a rough time lately i been into nothing but women ive never thought about men until a week ago im very upset and depressed about this its not normal to me i looked at gay porn more than once to prove that im not gay i get the same results each time and i feel disgust this is tough on me im scared that i looked too many times i keep thinking about it and shake all the time,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gaywhether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up and your own tolerance for being a unique individualexamining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effortthe more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it
416,i dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger thats really the only one i feel,anger managementbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,well then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you havewhat is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings  your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feelsometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they werein some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind  by knowing where your difficulties started you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelingsalso spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are  often people who have difficulty in expressing themselves suffered shame and humiliation as a child  they have a chronic sense of worthlessness and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression  by having a good time being with yourself you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating
417,im a little paranoid my mind does get the best of me one night i put chairs under all of my door knobs because i thought someone might break in i also think a lot which is probably the reason for the paranoia i cant stand loud noises like the sound of cars going by the grocery store is too noisy and i feel like people are looking at me,anxiety,anxiety disorders,paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid  they believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threatsfrom what you write you are aware that your actions may be understood as extremeinstead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category try seeing each of the behaviors you list here as your own uniquenessthis way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendenciesif you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid it is simply the way of who you areone possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself  they may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream  from what you describe you already are dealing with what you call paranoia
418,i love him so much and i dont know what to do,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you dont love himask him this so you will clearly know his definition of love
419,my life is completely normal yet i feel empty inside i feel as if i already know why im alive to reproduce and die,depression,mood disorders,are there any times or moments in which you feel other than empty  start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than emptyif there is no recent example then in your mind go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty  recall what you liked about this time whether you were by yourself or with others what type of activity you were involved at the time of nonemptinesshow did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die  if this is what your parents siblings and extended family believe it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and havent yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of livinggive yourself the time to browse around online or in person social meet ups on your interests  it is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life that are brand new to you and which connect to your true selfthis is one way of respecting your individuality which of itself may decrease your sense of emptiness
420,he is verbally abusive when he gets mad he just yells at me at times i feel scared,domestic violencemarriage,mood disorders,good for you on recognizing your own feelings  often in an abusive relationship the person who is being abused starts doubting themselves and starts tolerating then accepting abusemarriage is based in love and feeling taken care of by the partner  feeling scared is the opposite of thisif you feel ready tell him the way you feel and pay attention to how willing your husband is to being aware that he yells and that you feel scaredif he has no idea of what youre talking about doesnt want to understand what you feel then slowly take steps to understand within yourself whether or not tolerating your husbands behavior is acceptable to live with on an everyday basis
421,i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,anxiety,anxiety disorders,where you put your attention is where you will go i forget who said this first but its very powerful if all you think about and talk about is how annoying you think you might be that will get annoying your intense self reflection is lovely it will help you monitor yourself so that youre not affecting others negatively but your alarm is going off too easily here and you risk having the opposite effectyou dont have to be perfect shes with you so she probably likes you as you are she seems to put far less emphasis on your possibly annoying traits we all have faults and if thats what we focus on thats all we will see my hunch is that your most annoying trait might be your negative selftalk how ironic is thattheres another irony hereyour goal is to be a better partnerbut when you are selfcritical your focus is on you not her every moment that fear grabs ahold of you is a moment that youre not being present in the actual relationship youre gazing at your imagined faults fear steals your ability to focus on your loving partner maybe take a moment to image how she sees youall of you put yourself in her shoes to see the entire youhow are you lovingthoughtfula good partner confidence is a very attractive quality
422,my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hello it doesnt feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you especially if your feelings have not changed it can be scary frustrating and lonely have you tried talking to him about your concerns i would suggest to start there there may be several reasons for his actions some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and depending on his response may cause some relief when initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive there are a few things that you want to remember tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong avoid using extreme black and white language ie always and never for example you may say something such as i feel confused that we are rarely intimate and im wondering if youve also noticed this change versus you are never intimate with me anymore dont be afraid to ask him questions you deserve to know what is going on as his behavior is effecting your well being i like to ask openended questions instead of yes and no questions it allows for more clarity and deeper explanation lastly ask yourself and possibly him what part you play in the recent changes does he feel that youve been distant does he need something from you let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team if communication attempts fail seeing a couples therapist can be a great benefit having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationshipbest of luck to you
423,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,mood disorders,"what a beautiful discussion of guilt and shame lynda offers those
two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young then grow with us to
become quite formidable id like to throw in a technique i learned from randy
rausch author of the last lecture called the step apology
i teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize
to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselvesyes when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget
that there is part of us that just doesnt know how to apologize effectively
here goesstep one say what you did and the damage it causedstep two say youre sorry and accept full
responsibility no excuses no explanation no defensiveness it was all my
faultstep
three ask what you can do to repair the damagestep three is the one many of us didnt learn growing up and when
we add it to an apology we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light
as it is of course sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone
is offered so be it we cant control this but if we are apologizing to
ourselves we can there is always a way to make amends if we put our heart
into it
give this a try the next time youre reluctant to let yourself off
the hook you might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when
invited"

425,i have been dating a guy for two years i think i love him but i dont know any more i am in my late teens and i have been living with him for most of our relationship i have been talking to a guy friend and i feel more loved by him than my boyfriend,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hi michigan relationships are so sparkly for a few years and then things start to feel different most of the time this is simply because weve pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning we stop talking a lot because we have less to discoverwe do less for each other and buy fewer giftsspend less time togetherall because we have already formed the love and attachment and we dont need to fill the gas tank as much so just because it feels different doesnt mean its gone badhaving said that it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need you dont feel loved enough right now can you tell him have you told him the strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are let him know what you need and see if he gets it you have choices to make and there is no wrong choice you certainly have the right to say this isnt feeling great anymore or i want to explore other relationships and walk away but often its worth it to see how good something can be before you bail youre drawn to someone else and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new your boyfriend cant compete with that if he doesnt know youre unhappy for some people being drawn to someone else is a sign theyre not into their partner for others its a danger alert and it makes them want to improve their current relationship which one are you
426,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,mood disorders,a lot of times it is not about forgiveness but learning from experiences as an example as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward experiences allow us to grow find a balance and what to do and what not to do in order to move forward on the positive side you now know the consequences as for your actions not to take the same course forgiveness comes with time as you learn how to walk again
427,people have been calling me names and i have had enough of it i cannot stand it anymore im done i have told someone this and that is why i am writing this the thoughts are awful,depression,mood disorders,its sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well i think it is great that you are reaching out and i can tell that you want this to change working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on developing ways to cope and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences
428,we live with my expartners sister and her husband we have been there for five years now they are hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent they neglect to see this i do and it reflects in my childs behavior she sees them as stable but is upset that her dad isnt here and my intuition tells me she blames me to a degree because she doesnt know about his alcohol addictions,parentingfamily conflict,anxiety disorders,hi new york im happy to hear that your daughter doesnt know about her dads addictions although you dont say how old she is and i imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth i trust your instinct that now is not the time your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here and i can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent as much as this helps your daughter i sense that you also know you cant take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent children tend to blame themselves for a parents absence these children need extra love and support wherever they can get ityou say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter i understand that having your ex partners relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times it is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter but its also natural for people to want to assist you lets trust that their intentions are good if there is no evidence to the contrary as much as they support you they also  have emotional ties to your daughters father while there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation there are also many positive factors here that i invite you to seei dont know what your culture is but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her fathers heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life in general the more adults around loving and supporting a child the better it could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her fathers family nothing anyone else does can take your daughters love from you my hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has they are potentially wonderful connections and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they dont harm heri suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your exs family if you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy united supportive and loving safety net for herthats the best outcome of all
429,i was in a situation with a guy hes my brothers friend and kind of like a brother to me he invited me over to hang out and then came on to me i was instantly terrified to say no and i gave in i dont know whats wrong with me i cant figure out why im afraid to say no this is giving me a lot of guilt and depression,depression,mood disorders,hi tennessee there is nothing wrong with you there are many good reasons why you didnt say no you didnt say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary you also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people and to put the needs of other people first you instinctively want people to like you and people can be very coercive sexually you said it yourself you gave in he wore you downtheres nothing wrong with you it wasnt your job to say no women arent the gatekeepers of male sexual urges it was his job to get your consent first he pressured you into it a good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more if you said no what might happen then what might that mean about you what are you avoiding feeling unloved unwanted cold what would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no that you didnt have to do anything you dont want to do that youre special or that sexuality is special would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is i love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries and i urge a widespread conversation about what consent it men and women of all ages could use more of this training
430,"sometimes i cant stop thinking about life after death i was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven 
when i think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good i feel overwhelmed i dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever sometimes i just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety 
am i crazy i dont think these thoughts are normal",anxietyspirituality,anxiety disorders,hi california what youre experiencing is indeed anxiety its very common through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you wellits natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us our brains are complex wonderful things fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem so while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can getin general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you for example that person looked at you funny youre strange looking well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face and its unlikely it had anything to do with you for you personally your thoughts are about the afterlifeabout living forever what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever what would the worst part be a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear it might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go it might be that you fear going to hell because youre bad search for that deepest feari invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf its a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life thats whats happening now i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true the problem is how long youre holding it in your hand you could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf its not a problem the trick is to get it back on that shelfright now youre using distraction to do this youre trying to focus on other things around you but i think the glass is still in your hand its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf  and the key is in your thoughts once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear so as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you can control you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over with a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts i wish you the best
431,i have a problem with binge eating especially during times of stress i binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that i end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off i am in my late s and i have been dealing with this since i was a teenager are there any coping mechanisms i can use to break this cycle,stresseating disorders,stressrelated disorders,in dealing with an eating disorder you are far from alone  it is more common than you might think and tied to so many variables that it is easy for an individual to become overwhelmed in trying to navigate the influences of such variables  i have been working with individuals dealing with such challenges since  and have found over the years that behavioral analysis is highly effective in helping you begin to isolate understand and then be able to address many of these variable impacting your behavioral and cognitive choices  consider finding someone trained in dialectic behavior therapy dbt  there is a large body of evidence supporting the use of this approach to alleviating many of the aspects you identified in your post as well of a wide variety of tools that you can choose from and utilize that are able to practiced and assimilated into your daily tool box of coping mechanisms that end up becoming new behaviors and ways of thinking about issues that become automatic the best possible outcome you can hope for if you want the solution to be sustainable
432,we are the legal guardianship of our grandson he has been acting out and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year how are we to handle this,parenting,anxiety disorders,hi boone this depends a lot on his age and the situation the younger the child is in general the more i would see this as your decision not his a child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution some questions was the parent harmful to the child is the parent likely to be harmful to the child how likely is it to be a positive experience do you have any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen  i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contactonce you determine the risk of the childs need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense  the older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves there are other options than a facetoface he can write to his mom or dad text or email its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort when a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents i wish him the best and im grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson youre very special
433,we had our first kid  years ago and sex has been nonexistent ever since it only happens every three or four months we have been to counseling and i have been told over and over again she will come around she hasnt and im intimately lonely i think its time to move on but how do i do that without hurting my kids,intimacymarriage,mood disorders,hi pocahontas this is a painful situation when youre in a relationship you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection when it dries up its a very lonely place its possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship its also possible that your partner has hormonal issues pain issues  sexual dysfunction or is asexual there is no one answer here only you can decide what is right for you but let me ask some questions to help you explore next stepsaside from the sex is your wife loving and supportive what are the other ways in which you feel loved does your wife talk to you does she communicate her needs and desires does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex if your wife is generally a loving open partner you use this to see that her behaviours arent personal whether she resolves this or not it can help you to cope with the rejection this is your wifes issue and the ball is in her courtin my opinion if couples therapy hasnt helped its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship if you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out it can help you manage your own emotions pressure to have sex might push her further away did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship one good way to make sure you get is to give and i mean give what she wants not sex its appropriate to say to her now i cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy i need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually if this is all you want im not sure i can do it if you want us to be more sexual i need you to address what gets in the way for you  give her some time help her in any way you can and then see where you are see if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers thenyou have a decision to make i encourage you to make it looking at the big picture not just the sex
434,i have been experiencing a lot of sexual tension with a lot of the guys that i talk to nowadays i keep imagining having sex with them i have never had sex before nor have i had a boyfriend i feel lonely and empty i feel like my body is not okay and i am missing something i talk to so many boys in school and i always fantasize about half of them i want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time i am busy thinking about sex,human sexuality,anxiety disorders,hi montreal im glad you wrote what youre experiencing is normal were sexual beings we have a builtin desire to connect sexually with others because it feels good to keep procreation going and mostly to connect with other people because connecting with others makes us feel fulfilled and valuable sexual desire is a healthy part of you maybe your body is telling you it wants to dive into that water and taste it instead of just staring at it it sounds like youre beginning to explore yourself sexually and thats okayat your young age you also have another innate burning desire and that is to know yourself i see both of these desires burning and competing in you its a bit of a crazy timeyou want to connect with others but youre not sure who you are or what you want from them you want to know yourself but you cant learn about yourself in a vacuum its okay to trust your instincts its okay to connect sexually with others as long as youre preventing disease and pregnancy and you know how to protect your boundaries but even as i write this i think maybe im being controlling and overprotective of you its your body and youre in charge of what happens to it but i do want you to be safewhatever that means to you maybe talk to someone you trust with each encounter you have with other people sexual or not you will learn more about yourself and what you want both sexually and just in relationship or friendship you will develop a sense of who you arehave you tried to get to know yourself sexually this is a super place to start and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others when you explore your own body what feels good what brings you to orgasm i wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely 
435,i selfharm and i stop for awhile then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm,addictiondepressionselfharm,mood disorders,in a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction  according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this  when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better  if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior  another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences  consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior   someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy andor interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you
436,i feel insecure in my life i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues i have had a drinking problem for a few years i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to but because i have lately been on edge ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years im paranoid about driving on main roads im very jumpy at the slightest noises,addictionsubstance abuseanxiety,anxiety disorders,given the description you have posted here it may be time to find someone to work with  first and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research  there are however ways to address this  as for coping mechanisms the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the dialectic behavior therapy model dbt which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation  mindfulness another component of dbt should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence  there are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships  well worth looking intoseeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist  this is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of but sitting on it is not going to help it go away  think of it this way if you broke your arm would you just wrap it up and hope for the best or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound  the same applies here  think of it as first aid for the mind
437,i avoid talking to him because he always makes me more upset i cant be honest with him about anything because he is always rude to me,family conflict,mood disorders,hi troy i totally get this its a dilemma you want your dad to know how hes hurting you but you dont feel safe enough to say anything to him your reaction is understandable its his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open but thats not who your dad is your dad is your dad and waiting for him to change wont really help nothing you do can change your dad butthere are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him while your response of avoiding him is understandable i wonder what effect it has on your dad its possible that hes feeling frustrated rejected and punished by your withdrawal you may think he knows that youre feeling hurt but he probably doesnt so this is the squirrel chasing its tail your dad is rude so your habit is to be silent then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated his frustration comes out as more rudeness which makes you want to withdraw more and the cycle starts all over again you cant change his part of the cycle but you can change yoursare you willing to take a risk can you be honest about how youre feeling whats the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad you know why i avoid you i stay silent because when i talk to you say rude things so if you want me to talk i need to know you can listen i imagine it would come out differently because youre a few generations younger than me but put that into your own wordsi dont know the level of your dads rudeness if he is abusive then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this i dont want to put you at any risk but if you dont worry your dad will hurt you maybe give honesty a trymy point is that as rude as your dad may be checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude its powerfulyour silence your dad cant read your mind and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with himand if youre both open to it seeing a therapist together can be really helpful 
438,as a child my parents injured my brother so they went to prison i was there when he had gotten hurt but i cant seem to remember i also cant remember being with them quite well its a blur,trauma,mood disorders,its important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help  the blur in your memories is your brains attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past  to recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust  when you are ready and feel safe those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories  this will help to lessen the potency of the memory help to make sense of what has happened and allow you to begin the healing process  check into therapist who are trained in emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
439,i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,depression,mood disorders,as far as the formal diagnosis of depression goes it would be hard to determine without more information it sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world almost as if it is trapped inside of your body many people who are depressed experience such things as intrusive thoughts emotional numbness difficulty expressing themselves and bodily tension caged animal in working with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what you are going through the nature of the disconnect between you inner feelings and outer expression and eventually gain relief from the distress as well as a greater sense of connection with yourself and personal freedom
440,as a child my parents injured my brother so they went to prison i was there when he had gotten hurt but i cant seem to remember i also cant remember being with them quite well its a blur,trauma,mood disorders,sorry to hear of having witnessed violence within your family when you were very youngyour blocked memories are a selfprotection from the enormous emotional pain and feeling destabilized by realizing that the people whom you expected to trust are harmfulalready you are at the first step which is to know that memories exist about the disturbing events concerning your brotherprobably the best way of finding your way back to those times is by paying attention to all of who you are todaythe more intently and with loving interest you are able to notice yourself you will be gradually dissolving the layers of protective thoughts about intimacy being unsafebasically you will be teaching yourself how to slowly trust yourselfsince trust is what was violated while you were young you will be developing a new model for trusting yourself and othersthen more of the memories of your painful and overwhelming times will make themselves available to youthey are simply waiting for you to be strong and trusting enough within yourself to tolerate them
441,i have not had a friend since i was  i dont go anywhere and i have no job all because im afraid of people,anxiety,anxiety disorders,individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want in group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another
442,i feel insecure in my life i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues i have had a drinking problem for a few years i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to but because i have lately been on edge ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years im paranoid about driving on main roads im very jumpy at the slightest noises,addictionsubstance abuseanxiety,anxiety disorders,sorry hearing about the big amount of stress which you are feeling at this timesince a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy being with you would you consider continuing the conversation with her about your understanding of her answer to youyour observation that she says one thing and behaves in a different way is meaningfulbringing your point to her attention would at the very least demonstrate her interest in showing and explaining her viewpoint about youbasically youd be expecting her to care about you and how she handles herself with this question may clarify what youre trying to find outthe good news about your relationship with alcohol is that you realize youre overdoing itfrom what you write the emotional pain and helplessness you feel currently seem too much to know about all at onceone possibility is to accept your feelings of hurt and insecurity  this is the first step of working with them   if they start feeling overwhelming then maybe too you can distract yourself for a while from the intensity by engaging in an activity that is not selfharmingafter all you are the most important person in your life so keep yourself safe and healthy
443,my issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself my rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor it causes violent thoughts but i never act i stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent not me i dont want to drown myself in anger and resentment,anger management,anxiety disorders,knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel are fine qualitiesanger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into wordstry thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such timesalso if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations   even without drinking the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memoryif this describes part of your childhood then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express
444,i always see the worst end of things my boyfriend and i arent talking and i swear hes leaving me i keep failing my road test and i see my future crumble i have no desire for friends i pushed my best friend away after christmas and i have no desire to fix it or make new friends my aunt died and i cry all the time even if i burn my lunch,depressiongrief and loss,mood disorders,i really love that youre taking responsibility for your pessimism here theres a modern parable about two young brothers one child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine and hes miserable the other is in a room full of horse manure and hes flinging it around with joy so then someone comes and asks the first boy why hes so miserable because he has so much he says that hes missing the one toy that he really wants then the brother is asked why hes so happy in a room full of manure and he says with all this sht theres gotta be a pony in here somewherehappiness is a state of mind and i hear you saying that you used to be happy so maybe this means you believe its possible thats a wonderful startresearch on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism you say i always see the worst end of things thats pessimism life is like an elephant if all you see is roughness backup and walk around the view will change the key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as  temporary this will pass i know how to fix friendships  specific not involving the whole of your life and  not your fault tons of people fail road tests on the flip side it helps if we can see good things as  more permanent  bleeding into other areas of our lives and  something you created not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women the feelings you are having are temporary youre in a slump and its a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different i think you know how but you lack energy right now if tackling this on your own isnt enough a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy i wish you the best
445,i was in a relationship with him for three years my mom doesnt like it because she thinks im making a mistake he got married a few months after we broke up and now he is divorced i forgave him for what he did in the past and he says hes sorry and he really loves me i love him too but is it bad that im giving him a second chance again,relationships,anxiety disorders,hey it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes your mom wants to protect you i get that maybe she is worried youll be hurt again were you hurt in some way by him can you understand where shes coming from sometimes when were mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom its hard to know how to repair moms relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong that the picture you may have painted of him isnt the total picture she might need help there thank your mom for her love and care and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether youre together or not that its a risk you are going to take and that you really need her support 
446,i was anxious to go to middle school i was afraid of what people might say about me so when school started i wasnt acting like myself i was quiet which im usually not i didnt talk to anybody and didnt have any friends then a few years later my grandma died i really became depressed and stop going to school for a little i hated myself and still do i just need help i need someone to care for me i need someone to show that they care,depression,mood disorders,i agree you need more care and support no one deserves to feel alone or like they hate themselves were all wonderful imperfect complicated people and were at our best when were all helping each other im glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes i can tell that youre smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connectedyou not being yourself and then how you felt when your grandma died when grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you didnt seem to give it to you maybe my hunch is that they wanted to but that they didnt know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly the older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but thats how it works when you started middle school it sounds like you changed you got more quiet right that must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself it sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldnt like you fear can be silly so then fear got you to not show yourself and when we dont show ourselves people cant see who we are they dont know us as well and then they dont know what we need and they cant care for us as well either fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you it does that to a lot of us so where youre at right now is because of what fear did to you and also because when grandma died you were already isolated so people couldnt see your pain and know that you needed support theres a simple solution but youd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say get off my back youre not helping me by telling me lies can you be brave enough to go back to your old louder self if you talk to the people closest to youtell them what you think and how you feel then theyll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve i wish you well as you try this
447,ive been with the mother of my child for years,selfesteemrelationships,mood disorders,i would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better  i would suggest that you get to know yourself   what do you need in a relationship  what is holding you to this relationship other than your child  what have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect  just a few questions to ask yourself
448,we just cannot seem to get along i cannot have a conversation with her without it turning into world war  she treats me like i have no right to an opinion and never really lets me speak my real mother cares and tries to help me but she cant do much because my adoptive mother wont listen to her either,family conflict,mood disorders,going to see a experience counselor would be my advice  you will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding  if she doesnt agree to counseling really the only person you can change is you  i would suggest that you approach her with love and let her know what you appreciate about her let her know the great things she have done that could not be replaced or forgotten however you want your relationship to get better than it has been lately  hopefully this will open the door of communication where you can explain your thoughts and feeling but in a loving way
449,i started seeing this guy that i met at a mutual friends place he recently broke up with his exgirlfriend and started seeing me everything was great in the beginning then i started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his exgirlfriend again its all i think about i am still seeing him but things have changed because i am at a loss for words i get stuck in my own thoughts i like and care for him a lot he just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies,relationshipsanxietyselfesteem,anxiety disorders,sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts  as you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  what is contributing to these negative thoughts  his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question
450,i am a survivor of multiple sexual abuserape experiences triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner im trying to learn to cope with them,trauma,mood disorders,have you tried counseling  having ptsd from multiple abusive sexual experiences is very overwhelming for one to handle alone  you may need the guidance experience and support of a professional to identify all the triggers that effect you and obtain the best coping skills that would work for you
451,i am a single mother as a child i was molested by my mothers boyfriend i never knew my father i started having children at  right after high school after having children i completely lost myself and gave all of my focus on my children now my children are getting older but i still dont know myself ive had several attempts at relationships and they all fail i stopped caring about a lot after my childrens father left me i fell into a spiral and got depressed,depressionselfesteem,mood disorders,what your are experience is normal for most women  we usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside  so to answer your question of how do you get to know yourself i usually do a  session course with my client by having them answer questions such as the following in the first session  what do i love other than your children  what are my own needs and desires  what  things have i accomplished in my life that im most proud of  what are  strengths or qualities i have  what is one event that had a major impact on my life  how have that event affected my life today   for their homework assignment after the st session they are asked to write a letter to self tell self what they love cherish appreciate and even admire about themselves  most women feel awkward at first but i remind them that the truth is that only to the extent that you are able to love and value yourself you are to love and support others
452,ive been with my boyfriend for a year and a half he loves me a lot and i love him it hurts to be apart from him for so long it hurts all over and then i feel like it wont last,anxietyrelationshipsbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,i would suggest that you look up the word codependency and its characteristics  see if you relate to those characteristics  i have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly  for some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss  considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues
453,i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,depression,mood disorders,it is hard to make a definite diagnosis however i would say  that it could be and or a combination of depression stress ptsd etc  more background information would have to be needed  one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms  if what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out  that would not be good when they do  get help before they do
454,weve been together almost three years we argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me its hurtful because i am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if i drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say i am sorry how can this be resolved we have kids and i dont want a broken family because we cant communicate,relationships,anxiety disorders,under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge so while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you in simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience and that still fell short of what you needed you are both still trying to get very early needs met the best advice i can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful and seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck pointavraham cohen phd rcc ccc

457,now that the other girl is out of the picture our sex life isnt the same is it because he is still thinking about the other girl,relationshipshuman sexuality,anxiety disorders,orbetter yet is it you still thinking about the other girl  i am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well  make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well  sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about

460,my grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment,parentingfamily conflict,anxiety disorders,parents are to teach discipline to children not punishment   punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt  there is a different in discipline and punishment  punishment could have long term affects on a childs self image and growth  it can lead to others issues such as bullying from peers as well  whatever your grandson has done there is a much better way of getting him to understand that his actions are not acceptable  punishment is not one them  encourage the stepmother to build a positive relationship with him this way he will learn to respect and trust her  his actions would improve  she may need to attend a parenting class for blended families
461,im depressed i have been for years i hide it from everyone because im scared of the reactions ill get last time i tried telling my parents it was a huge argument about me being too young to be depressed im a legal adult calling me ungrateful and telling me that if i cant handle things now its only going to get worse in the future which is turning out to be true its exhausting pretending to be okay and i dont know how much longer i can try im just really tired and sadly i cant afford the help i need on my own,family conflictdepression,mood disorders,dont think that you cant afford the help you need on your own  there are several counselors that see people on a sliding scale that can be as low as  based on your income  find a center that is nonprofit they have great counselors as well it sounds like you know what you are experiencing and know that you need someone to talk to someone that is willing to listen  your parents may not understand what your are feeling right now and that is not totally abnormali would encourage you to seek help immediately so you can live the best live you canwhich is not being depressed
462,i have several issues like i dont like people they make me sick i have issues with talking to people i feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me i have felt this way for years when i look people in the eyes i have voices that tell me to hurt them and if i dont stop looking at who i am talking to it gets so loud i cant hear what they are saying i just stay away from people to avoid this i look at people and think how i could hurt them i feel like i am worthless and would be better off not in this world where i dont fit in every day i wake up its like another day any info would be good,relationships,anxiety disorders,sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain  i would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically  then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist  seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms    after getting these evaluations your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing  whether treatment includes medication andor psychotherapist would be discussed  please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up
463,my husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me and i moved out he is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right im not sure if i trust that he will not go back to his old ways,marriagerelationship dissolution intimacy,mood disorders,i am glad he is seeing a counselor  that is something that most men struggle with doing at times  time will tell if his actions are of good intentions  however remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships   what part did you play  did you down play his disrespect at one time  did you give up the power of your own voice  did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided  did you allow him to make you doubt yourself   in others words if you do decide to give him another chance what would you do different  not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words at all but dont allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future  if you do decide to give it another try go in with a voice with the demand of respect with your needs and wants expressed and expected  with an increase in your self worth and confidence you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions   seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self
464,i have a problem with binge eating especially during times of stress i binge eat and feel so overwhelmed with shame and disappointment that i end up going to the gym and trying to exercise the calories off i am in my late s and i have been dealing with this since i was a teenager are there any coping mechanisms i can use to break this cycle,stresseating disorders,stressrelated disorders,hellothis question describes a very typical setup of what is called the  binge repent repeat cycle this means that typically after you binge you experience emotions as you described shame and disappointment and then because of these emotions you repent ie vow to never binge again promise to do better go to the gym etc and then ultimately end up bingeing again there are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to normalize eating meaning you need to attempt to eat normally eating appropriately portioned meals  times a day with snacks in between if you binge then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating then this actually leads to a binge again thus reverting you back to the cycle if you binge it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge although it may feel counterproductive getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle it can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past focus on what you can do differently next time what emotions or situations led up to the binge what can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge or the way that you handled the situation lastly if youre struggling with normalizing eating it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating i would be more than happy to assist you if you ever have any questions or want to reach out to somebody you can contact me via my website httpwwwmaddenwellnesskycom

468,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,anxiety disorders,the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable accurate ones as an example im scared of spiders but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind mindfulnessbased therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally truealthough it may seem counterintuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts goby remaining present in the body youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response
469,my parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay when they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual i dont know if i am ready to come out to them,family conflictlgbtq,mood disorders,perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents  often times our readiness is not dependent on what others will say or how they react but more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others reactions  it may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion eg your parents being supportive vs your parents being disappointed and so on how are you prepared to deal with the outcome  you may also seek help through counselors support groups andor individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents  all the best

when i think of living forever even if it is in heaven which should be good i feel overwhelmed i dont like the thought of living forever and ever and ever sometimes i just cant get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety 
am i crazy i dont think these thoughts are normal",anxietyspirituality,anxiety disorders,you need to find an outlet someone to talk to your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal but anyone could help just look to someone for help if you cant find anyone who you think will listen talk to your mom it can help greatly just to get the words out tell her how you feel about her passing but then also about everything else talk to her about your day tell her about happy things i dont know if youre a religious person or where you believe she is now but no matter what you can talk to her

477,ive had posttraumatic stress disorder for years without my parents ever finding out i want to overcome it but its so vivid its like its happening again im scared and paranoid i have depression which i have been struggling with since a young age,traumadepression,mood disorders,what is the reason you wouldnt want your parents to know you are trying to find your way through ptsdwould they believe that youve been traumatizedand do you feel that your parents had a hand in creating your traumathere is no need to tell your parents you have ptsd unless you feel that doing so will help you   maybe you intuitively realize that they dont want to understand or know about thishow did you come to the conclusion that you have ptsdif you are working with a therapist and a minor then  the laws of your state dictate what information your parents can ask your therapist about youif you are a grown person and working with a therapist  you have complete legally protected privacy of what you talk about with your therapistin any case a good starting point is to know exactly your own reason for wishing to keep your psychological situation hidden from your parents

now he wants me to wait on him to mature he wants to talk to other people then come back in four years he doesnt want to deal with me while im pregnant he doesnt take me to the doctor or anything i feel alone  how do i handle this situation",relationships,anxiety disorders,well as far as your boyfriend sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice  leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned  however this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level  having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up  this is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do  hopefully someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listenas for you  how do you handle this situation is your questionyou do what you have to do to prepare for your baby with or without him  a lot can happen in four years and you dont have time are not required and cant wait to see what will happen with him  you have a life to prepare for  to feed to protect and to love  can you tell your baby to wait i dont want to deal with you now i need to mature i will be back to see you later hope you will be fine  nope   as i always say you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing  develop healthy friendshipswhether with family friends or new people who may enter your life  your support system will grow and life will go onwith or with him  stay focus on you and your baby

481,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,anxiety disorders,this is a very common question in my practice panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue ex depression low selfesteem fears to decrease your anxiety symptoms its recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable within my practice i educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety starting a daily mindfulness practice for example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities understand your negative and positive thoughts many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious for example i dont need to worry i am calm and relaxed  exposure to fearful or anxious situations this can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure this may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease i hope this was helpful keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement

483,i found out my boyfriend takes antidepression medicine lately hes been saying he has a lot on his mind and he needs time to think about us weve only been dating  weeks but i like him a lot,relationships,anxiety disorders,give him the time and space he needs  obviously something is going on with him that he needs time to process think about and work through  respect that most men are not talkers but more thinkers  if and when he is ready to talk he will  when and if he does talk be a comforting listener and put yourself in his shoes the best you can to be the support he needs  dont take it personal because you just been dating  weeks and his depression maybe something that been going on for a while  if you do like himshowing him by being patient and supportive at this time
484,whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,anxiety,anxiety disorders,as you do it more it should get better or at less with less anxiety  anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public  i hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years  i even experienced that when i first became a counselor and had to lead classes  i asked myself why were i so anxious  i admit at that time i didnt have confidence in myself  the more i prepared and practiced the more my confidence level increased  yours will too

486,i am a teenage girl ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since i was very young the problem is that i dont remember anything about this dream i still know that its the same one and then i wake up in a panic and i cry really loud without knowing the reason why do i see the same dream why can i not remember it and what should i do to remember it,sleep improvementanxiety,anxiety disorders,there is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that i know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves one thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up people seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember
487,my mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though im in my s she argues with me over stupid stuff,stressfamily conflict,stressrelated disorders,this is a common issue you grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance im all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom ultimately you only have control over yourself so thats the place to start you can remind yourself that moms behaviours dont mean that she doesnt trust you or love you its just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range if you can see her responses as habits rather than a reflection of how she feels about you then you can keep yourself calm the more calm you are the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship take a look at the picture from her perspective she may feel overwhelmed with finances are you in college and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesnt know how to recruit help for i bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundryall those thankless mom tasks take a look at how she talks to you is she nagging about chores can you see that underneath the nagging theres a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance  okay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef she wants help you want respect lets talk about how you get bothi propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic momi see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want sell it as winwin then you write down some things that end up forming a contract the first part is stuff thats your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene moms voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and its a health hazard this is a mom says nothing about list the second part is about what mom needs from you what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult does she want you to contribute to rent buy your own food do your own laundry what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom how will these things be enforced what will happen if you dont follow through write it all down so its really clear it has to all be mutually agreed uponthe third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her you can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre  years old listen to what she wants too beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect youd be more willing to help out and i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less go for the winwin i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom 
488,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,anxiety disorders,the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks  chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were  see the illustration belowthis is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior panic attack allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations prompting events and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur consequences  finally  it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities such as not enough sleep poor nutrition trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred  working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as dbt or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events
489,whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,anxiety,anxiety disorders,"basically your response is the fight flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically the autonomic nervous system called the autonomic response  this system
is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe  it is largely an unconscious function but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations  one of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the nasa program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the
challenge with success  you can learn
more about his by going to ted talks what i learned about going blind in space it is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it 
with that being said finding a program
like a dale carnegie public speaking program can help  working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well good luck"
490,weve been together almost three years we argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me its hurtful because i am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if i drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say i am sorry how can this be resolved we have kids and i dont want a broken family because we cant communicate,relationships,anxiety disorders,you cant fix this by yourself but i applaud you for trying one person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort im reading between your lines here and i wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when youve done nothing wrong and ignore things youve felt hurt by i sense that youre doing all the workthat its not balanced i have worked with many couples and ive learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible anything is possible but in order for change in a couple to occur you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours and who have empathy your boyfriend doesnt appear to have these components he pushes you away and blames you when hes done something hurtfulcan you be honest with yourself about whats happening i encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are i wish you well

505,i work two jobs and go to school for criminal justice over the summer my father had a stroke it was very devastating my father isnt the same and my family fights every day i have been kicked out the house many times i break down a lot,stressfamily conflict,stressrelated disorders,you undoubtedly are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father family conflict as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule stress if left unchecked has many negative health related implications first and foremost i would recommend going to see a counselor at your collegeuniversity most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for  free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them secondly i would advise you to take a minute and breathe when confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress when dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care in other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace enjoyment and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress it is inevitable and a part of life but how you deal with stress as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life i hope this helps

507,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,anxiety disorders,anxiety is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety you do not reason with sensory states in the body if your system tells your in danger your stomache feels like it is knots your heart is beating out of your chest validate by just being present with it take your breath to it breath in and out of that space say ok i am in danger i always tell my clients a crying baby wants to be held not told to shut up listen to your system validate it like you do a child and see what happens
508,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,anxiety disorders,three years ago i attended a week long meditation retreat by the fifth day i noticed i was light headed and felt very strange i began to realize within my own being an experience of no separation i would see others at the retreat and smile i loved them all i could feel the connection with this awareness i had read about but never truly understood until that moment i remember understanding all the teachings i had learned throughout my life about a god who existed outside of me i realized i had all these answeres within my own being and so did everyone else i began to see everyone as not just capable but powerful loving beings since this experience it has been my desire for everyone to become conscious within whatever experience they wish i do this in many ways at our studio we combine mental health with yoga and meditation as well as nutrition counseling to help people come to their optimal selves to truly come into a state of finding yourself is to start to know and own who you are from a state of solid being in this there is nothing new under the sun and it is very simple i would love to teach you and anyone interested in coming into a state of awake conciousness  the more awake we are the more joyful we are i live in this state of being and demonstrate it in my daily life
509,i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like,human sexualityintimacyrelationships,mood disorders,i dont think theres anything that youre supposed to feel some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all it could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions when something we do is hiddena secretits easier to avoid feeling guilty i wonder if youre avoiding your own emotions but lets put that question aside for now there are better questionswhat do you want do you want your marriage if not this may be why you dont feel guilty do you want to be able to sleep with your friend its unlikely that both are possible keeping the marriage and the affair yes you get to do whatever you want with your bodyandthere may be consequences affairs almost always get discovered who do you want to be what kind of partner do you want to be what might your partner feel if they knew how might you feel then would you care has something happened thats affected how much you care about your partneri suggest that these other questions might be a place to start exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe i wish you the best as you sort it out 
510,ive been with him for a couple months we will talk everyday and he will get mad over something i will say and not talk to me we have our great moments but i just need to focus on my personal situations and i feel he is slowing me down with that i still wanna be with him but not now,relationships,anxiety disorders,it sounds like youre pulling away instead of being honest if you really want to be with him why not now if you dont have time for a relationship why are you dating at alli dont understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days or ghosting where you just stop talking and disappear i get the sense that this relationship isnt working for you but for some reason youre stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it in the early stage of a relationship the first year if it doesnt feel fabulous its a good idea to move on its not personal you dont owe this person anything they deserve someone whos totally into them and so do you and youre doing him no favors by hanging on to something thats not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime you dont have to slowly bow out it actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty maybe people dont know how to say itive decided not to continue with this i wish you the best life is too short
511,i am a female and i am afraid of having sex i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced i think he thinks im not a virgin i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex,human sexualityintimacy,mood disorders,these fears are completely normal almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience men also feel far more of these fears than you realize that can helpto remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approvalyou mention a partner but im not sure if you currently have one having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important when youre really confident someone cares deeply for you this can help the fears to go away or diminish how well do you know your own body getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feelgetting acquainted with your body yourself firstthis can help build sexual confidence in general our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear asideironically this is what makes you good in bed but be patient with yourself your confidence will grow with experience and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready theres not rush 
512,i get angry and act out it scares my wife and child,anger management,anxiety disorders,anger is a normal emotion no different than joy elation or sadness its not anger that gets us in trouble its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they dont readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they dont take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior in addition i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that youre angry remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion ie disappointment hurt frustration etc hope this helps
513,he isnt violent but he has anger issues and deep insecurities hes working on them and has improved we started counseling and he participated in one or two individual sessions but we broke up again shortly thereafter now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining,relationships,anxiety disorders,hello and thank you for your question i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence i was a little confused about whether youre are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it i am going to assume you are still undecided some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse even without physical abuse being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing when partners question and accuse they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations  the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them for example if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring the person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong but it doesnt matter and that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again here are just a few things they realize there is no right answer trying to be logical with someone who doesnt want to be logical doesnt work many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway in addition the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells   the find support finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea  they reinvest in themselves try to find some time for yourself this couldnt possibly sound more cliché but it is actually true whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one one thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspectivei dont know if you are still in counseling but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great if not there are others you can try its important to find the right fit as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner that is a question that can only be answered by you but you could ask yourself some questions  like these to help you decide what are some of my values about relationships do i want trust honesty ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me or does it seem to bring me down if i want to stay in this relationship what are some specific things that need to change hope some of these suggestions help good luck to you be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
514,i think i have depression anxiety bipolar disorder and i have anger issues i told my mom over and over again she told me she would get me a therapist but she never did i just found out that my mom cant afford a therapist for me,legal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,it can be difficult to get counseling if you dont feel supported by family members  there might be a few options  if you are in school id recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse  they often will be able to help you access free or affordable counseling resources in your community  in addition depending on where you live its also often possible to call  for referrals to free or low cost counseling services in your areaid encourage you not to give up you are on the right track
515,"i have a relative who is in his twenties  he was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again no one informed family that he was using drugs again  he subsequently overdosed and was found dead
is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed is there a legal case for failing to report",professional ethicslegal  regulatoryaddiction,anxiety disorders,im so sorry to hear of your loss  this sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws i would suggest talking with a local attorney  that being said i see two competing issues here  on the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative  on the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm  generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesa local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation
516,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,social relationshipssubstance abuse,mood disorders,hello thank you for your question i have a worked with many people who have become addicted to benzodiazepines like clonazepam it is a difficult road for people who are trying to become clean it is also a very difficult road for those who love the person and are trying to be supportive during those times it is important to remember to take care of yourself too as for taking your friends pills my concern would be the legal ramifications that you could face should you ever be caught with someone elses prescription medication and especially these types of medications our laws have become much more strict surrounding prescription drug sales and possession due to the increase in prescription drug abuse in addition people who are in active addiction are likely to find some other means to get their drug so it would do little to help the overall problem i dont know about your friends family situation but they may be a better route to take if you are concerned about your friend they may already be involved but with your help you may be able to convince your friend to go to treatment willingly that is usually better in many states there are also involuntary committal processes where a persons family may be able to convince a court to force the person into treatment this varies from state to state if your friends family is not aware of this option it may be something to look into it usually does take a relative or a medical provider to begin this process if it is available i hope this was helpful and i wish you and your friend well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
517,im concerned about my boyfriend i suffer from anxiety but i always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in bdsm intercourse we havent tried it but ive had this feeling he always wants to,human sexualityanxiety,anxiety disorders,"hello thank you for your question there are few things
that people find more personal than their sexual relationships when we feel
connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread however if
we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful 
i dont know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea the only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way if you
believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe it sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority 
assuming you are able to share with him your feelings
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties all parties should feel respected and able to say no to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with 
i call the respectful agreement between sexual partners sex
trust sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries it means they
wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having  your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important 
now if there is a part of you that is curious about bdsm
and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information i will warn you some websites and articles
are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed 
many people engage in bdsm and have happy relationships but
again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants it is
also important to know that bdsm is not just one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort if it is something you are uncomfortable with
then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it
 
i hope this was helpful be well

518,he isnt violent but he has anger issues and deep insecurities hes working on them and has improved we started counseling and he participated in one or two individual sessions but we broke up again shortly thereafter now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining,relationships,anxiety disorders,sometimes relationships just do not work  dont feel that the first second or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life   the one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up  it is good you all went to counseling but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior  it takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal  i would suggest doing youmeaning focusing on your own growth at the time  if he wants to grow with you he will make the necessary steps  if he doesntwish him well
519,i have had a crush on this guy for years i last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school we left off on a good note should i message him and see how he is doing or is it too late,relationshipssocial relationships,anxiety disorders,its never to late to let a person know how you feel  you never know where it will take you  you dont want to hold this regret of not letting your feelings known and wondering what if for the rest of your life   that can be torturous   now prepare for whateverif his feelings are the same or if they are not  if they are the samegreat  if they are not feel good that at least you let a person know they hold a special place in your life and wish him love peace and happiness in his life
520,i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present,social relationships,anxiety disorders,take one day at a time  each day do things that make you happy moves to a positive place focusing on the future give you a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment  journal at the end of the day of how well you did that day in focusing on these things  each day should be a step better than the previous day  you will have days that you didnt do as wellthat is human and ok  just get back on track the next dayat the end of the week review how well you did and give your self a grade  if did well you deserve ice cream etc  if not so good oktell yourself next week got to focus one day at a time  you can do itit takes practice but will get better each day  i wish you happy days and happy future
521,i love him but he doesnt show me love he talks badly about me to his friends,marriage,mood disorders,so many questions comes to mind when i read your wordsdo you love yourself  what do you love about him  what are you getting from this relationship that is good for you  what are you lacking in yourself that you allow yourself to be treated this wayi can go onif you can answer these questions maybe you will answer your own question of why are you with your husband or even better why you allow your husband to be mean show no love disrespect you  you seem to lack selfworthseek a professional to help you with this
522,we dont have sex a lot i cheat when we argue i dont kiss or have unprotected sex with them its a one time thing and i never see them twice,intimacyhuman sexualitymarriage,mood disorders,"hello and thank you for your question the question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you however here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
    
do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals this is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy if you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that however if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright finally if you value your husbands feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values that can only be determined by you 
      based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is  from the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument this
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt we can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep the pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs 
       what are your goals for this relationship if we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed none
of which requires any intimacy at all are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
      
have you considered seeking marital counseling not
having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them if there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed 
 hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship i certainly
wish you well

523,i love him but he doesnt show me love he talks badly about me to his friends,marriage,mood disorders,"hello and thank you for your question loving someone who
doesnt respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful 
many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtful
relationship say that it was wonderful when it first started but that over
time their partners behaviors changed and they became emotionally or
physically abusive 
i want to say right away that it is not your fault in any
way if someone is abusive to you it does not mean that you are broken or that there
is something wrong with your character if you have not left the situation
people stay for many reasons such as fear finances children pressure from
others and love 
many people have had to leave their abusive partners who
they still love to preserve their own safety and regain the sense of self they
may have lost it is a very difficult thing to do even if you know it is the
right thing 
the person who really needs to take a hard look at
themselves is the person doing the abusing
it is very common for mental and emotional abuse to wear
away at someones selfesteem this can lead to other problems like depression
and anxiety these issues sometimes require professional support to manage
such as a counselor or perhaps a doctor who may prescribe medication 
a counselor may be able to help you sort through your fears
and concerns about staying or leaving to look at things from different angles
and to help you decide what is best for you 
you have not said that your husband has been physically abusive
to you but if that has been the case then you must consider your physical
safety first leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time
getting help from professionals would be critical and i would recommend your
local domestic violence program 
whatever you decide to do is the right thing for you i
would encourage you to ask yourself honestly about your reasons for staying and
the barriers that may keep you from going you do deserve to be happy and
emotionally safe if you do not feel like you have that safety then seeking
someone to help you sort through these things is a good plan 
i wish you well

524,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,social relationshipssubstance abuse,mood disorders,first of all where did you find the pills did you have to go into her private space or things to find them if so you might want to do some research on codependency i recommend the book the everything guide to codependency you can find it here httpswwwamazoncatheeverythingguidecodependencycodependentdp  its not honest to go searching through someones things you dislike the deceit in her so why model it in yourselfif the pills were just left out thats a different story again though model honesty talk to about what you found avoid being accusitory a good old i found thesewhats going on with this might be a good place to start tell her how it makes you feel have you ever heard of i statements google thisyou will find a lot of good templates on how to frame this conversation at the end of the day though these are her choices not yours all you can do is tell her how you feel make a few gentle suggestions and get back to taking care of you if it gets to the point where seeing her downward spiral is too much for you let her know this and tell her you can no longer be involved for the sake of your own health and sanity there is nothing wrong with trying to help but ask yourself are you really being helpful if you are starting to feel resentful know that you have crossed the line into codependency and back awayhope this helps and all the bestaleisha
525,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,mood disorders,forgiveness takes time you know what you did and by the sounds of it you are not impressed with yourself in my mind this is a sign that you are a good person you recognize that you did something that crossed your own moral code you could have just done this thing and not felt anything  but you do feel and that is ok its not supposed to feel good when you do something wrongbe patient with yourself these things can take time i suspect that you will be one of those people who slowly let go of their shame and guilt the trick is to feel the pain but to not ignoredetach from the life that you are living right now dont deprive yourself of the opportunity to feel joy again
526,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,social relationshipssubstance abuse,mood disorders,your good intentions to help your friend stay clean are very caring about herunless your friend feels like stopping pills  taking them away will mean she finds them some place elsethe problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax physically addictedtaking pills has basically become a standard part of your friends lifeher problem is bigger than your ability to careif you havent already done so tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pillsthis is not a guarantee that shell stopit isa way of you showing that you care about heroffering love and advice are the only things you can do for hermeanwhile knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting yoube sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself  offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using
527,i constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down its ruining my mood and even my whole self i have trouble sleeping and i keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me,selfesteemsleep improvement,mood disorders,the problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spiritare there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates youhave you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpointor does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind as though you anticipate that others will not like what you sayif actual conversations are leading you to feel left out then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other personor you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out are no longer worthwhile ones for youif the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others
528,my parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay when they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual i dont know if i am ready to come out to them,family conflictlgbtq,mood disorders,"hello and thank you for your question being bisexual can be particularly
difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are supposed
to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays it happens so
often that there is actually a term for it  
bierasure this is simply something that happens when people deny that
bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs
like your parents seem to have 
the unfortunate truth is that you can never
be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information it sounds
promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may
simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality with accurate
information they may come around but there is no way to be sure 
some of my colleagues have already given you good information here are some more things that you can consider
and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them
 
      if they dont respond the way you want them to have you developed a support
system to support you through it this is very important the truth is that all
the friends in the world wont prevent pain or sadness if your parents dont
respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you are
okay as you are and that is critical for you to remember 
 
      there is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can
offer your parents if you think it would be helpful it may be important for
them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young
people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality here is an article from
glaad about bierasure httpwwwglaadorgbisexualbierasure
 
      coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take
place when you are ready sometimes people get pressured from friends media
and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are
ready it really is up to you if you are feeling pressure from others dont
feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out
on your own time intimate partners should respect you enough to understand
this 
 
      something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual just
because someone is lgbtq doesnt mean that they necessarily want to be many
people struggle with this having
your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are
in telling your parents so perhaps do some selfexploration about your
feelings toward yourself 
 
sometimes people take friends with them
when they decide to come out to their parents this is something you may want
to consider the important thing to remember is that you are okay really if
your parents dont respond well that doesnt mean that they never will some
start off upset but then work their way through it 
best of luck to you

529,i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like  they just want nothing to do with me,social relationshipsselfesteem,mood disorders,it sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsone possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult you ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and i hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer
530,im a teenage girl and my dad is an alcoholic i hate being at home with him because he just stresses me out he can be picking me up from basketball practice or piano lessons and half of the time i dont even know if hes sober or not i refuse to get into the vehicle with him and walk home sometimes ive either been barely sleeping or i over sleep so im always tired i live in a small town so theres no one i can really talk to because im not really that close with my family,family conflictstresssleep improvement,stressrelated disorders,"hello and thank you for your question you are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help good for you i
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too

first good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions  such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated it is really important that you consider your safety above all
else 
to answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other peoples actions there are various
reasons why we do this for one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault and depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it what is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around 
as for the other things you mentioned i am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing it sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school 
you may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on i will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily if you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report 
if you dont know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to they may have some ideas 
sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things you may be able
to find something like that in your state i do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful 
this is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that i encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy try really hard not to let that happen if
you have interests do them if you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well exercise can really help when
we get stressed 
i hope some of this was helpful good luck

531,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck unfortunately it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away however i will give you some ideas and hopefully this will helpone of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesnt usually do much to help us in the longrun people may make changes for a shortterm period of time because they feel guilty about something they did but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they dont have something else to help them change permanently such as a new skill so guilt doesnt necessarily help us in fact as i write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol for whatever reason this is just a common thing that we do now accountability is different than guilt accountability can actually be constructive  when you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong that it hurt others and you deeply regret it that you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesnt happen again that you have done what you can to make amends if necessary that you are sorry and then you move on why is moving on necessary well for one thing it doesnt usually help the people who you hurt in fact someones guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt over and over again about what happened guilt is usually  about us and not about those we hurt also guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more having said all of that guilt is a normal human emotion sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away sometimes we need help to work through it there are many selfhelp books about forgiving yourself you can try amazon to find some or consider getting help from a counselor be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
532,im in love with my own gender and my parents are against that i dont know how to tell them because im afraid theyll not want me anymore,lgbtqfamily conflict,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question this is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly but unfortunately i cant do that there is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them the truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways some have told their parents directly some drop hints some have had others tell their parents etc the only right way to come out is the one that you choose the one that feels right to you that is the best way some people decide not to come out and some wait for a very long time both of these things are okay coming out is deeply personal and there can be real consequences to someones emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person that is why it should only be done when you are ready when you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk sometimes people can feel pressured to come out but i encourage you to do it in your own time the truth is there is a spectrum of how peoples parents react to this kind of news on one end you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a coming out party most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle it is important to remember that their feelings may change over time many parents struggle at first but they love their kids and get better with it over time if you decide to tell them consider taking someone along to support you plan ahead on what you want to say it can be an emotional time so do what you need to do to take care of yourself if you need to leave you dont have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you i wish you well and good luckrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
533,ive had posttraumatic stress disorder for years without my parents ever finding out i want to overcome it but its so vivid its like its happening again im scared and paranoid i have depression which i have been struggling with since a young age,traumadepression,mood disorders,"i understand that at times its difficult to share with our parents what we have been trough due to fear of judgment or punishment but i have noticed that keeping our experiences secret intensifies them  and post traumatic stress disorder can haunt us for a long time if we do not learn to process the memories that cause those symptoms  if you have been victim of a traumatic event that you are not prepared to share with your parents its important that you seek help with a counselor therapist or psychologist  trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy is a great technique to cope with physical symptoms you could also use narrative therapy creative therapy or journaling as a way to express memories and process them with your therapist  a psychiatrist can also prescribe medication to manage the symptoms but is very important that you address the trauma so you can heal and go back to live your life   many organizations like the united way  in many states offer resources and referrals to put you in touch with mental health providers you could also talk to your school counselor doctor or church to find referral that could help tip you dont have to tell you story to each person you ask for help you can just start by asking for a counselor referral cómo puedo superar el desorden de estrés post traumático sin que mis padres se enterencomprendo que muchas veces puede ser difícil compartir nuestras experiencias con nuestros padres muchas veces por miedo a que nos juzguen o castiguen pero he observado cómo mantener un secreto lo vuelve más fuerte y difícil de manejar   el desorden de estrés post traumático puede ser una condición que nos persigue por mucho tiempo si no aprendemos a procesar las memorias que causan esos síntomas  si has sido víctima de un trauma que tal vez no estás listoa para compartir con tus padres es importante que busques la ayuda de algún consejero profesional terapista o sicólogo  la terapia cognitiva conductual enfocada en el trauma es una técnica que te ayudara a manejar muchos de los síntomas también puedes utilizar diarios o terapia narrativa o creativa para expresar memorias y procesarlas luego en terapia  un psiquiatra también te puede proveer medicamentos que ayudan a manejar los síntomas del estrés post traumático pero es importante que atiendas el problema inicial para poder sanar por completo y volver a tomar las riendas de tu vida   muchas organizaciones como los fondos unidos  en muchos estados tiene recursos que proveen referidos a consejeros o profesionales de la salud mental  también puedes preguntarle a tu consejero escolar doctor o en la iglesia

538,i got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights i thought i was going to die then about a week later i started having this desire to be female i never had this desire before all i can think about is being a woman i dont get pleasure from my penis anymore either women are attractive but not like before i can also find men attractive now im too ashamed to tell anyone,behavioral changelgbtq,anxiety disorders,"hello and thank you for reaching out to ask for help surely this is a very confusing time for you if you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself 
my guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence but i understand how you would make the
connection 
i have a feeling that a few things may be going on here it
is really hard to say since i dont know you how old you are etc but i will
share you with you some thoughts 
some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff
it avoid it etc is not always successful in fact its usually not 
its like telling you not to think of pink elephants i
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now 
so rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement where is this thought coming from what are my feelings
about it asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on 
one possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender i get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility and that is okay 
you can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion i would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues you can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website what is
important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are
experiencing 
 
i wish you well

540,it happens especially at me and my sister and then she gets emotional and brings up the past how should i deal with it she is always stressed about her work and doesnt put her family first,family conflict,mood disorders,anger is a normal emotion and yet it is a really hard one how much is too much and how do you express it without damaging those around you yes moms get angry sometimes too easy but its their responsibility to manage their anger get their own support and put themselves in time outs when they cannot handle it well  since you are the kids you shouldnt have to fix or calm down moms anger maybe in a calmer time when you guys are being silly talk with her one on one tell her  you are feeling sad and hurt that she gets upset at you girls ask her if there is  thing you can work on this next month to help her ask her if she would work on  thing for you this month not yelling taking a time out telling you before she blows her top so you can exit the room also for you check out a library book on anger so you know how to handle yours and one on parents and anger number one to remember if you dont feel safe if she is calling you names or hurting you breaking things etc make sure you go to a trusted adultschool counselor neighbor aunt church friend as soon as possible you are much too important to be hurt and if mom is out of control someone else needs to be caring for you

558,"how do i ever trust another woman i have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that i meet i am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions
once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application",marriagefamily conflictprofessional ethicslegal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,im sorry to hear about that situation if the woman was your therapist or had been at one time this could represent a significant ethical violation when she created a dual relationship with youeven if you were not her client this might still be an ethical violation counselors are held to a high standard of conduct and honesty at all timesin a situation like this you might consider filing a complaint with the state regulatory board
559,can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor every detail about what happened during the other parents visitation in order to help build a case for child custody,relationshipsprofessional ethicsparentinglegal  regulatory,anxiety disorders,"i see a few issues herefirst the age of the child is important  if the child is considered an
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age  and age  no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions 
if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law"
560,i terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago i am now realizing that i would like to begin counseling again  the social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in  hours but he hasnt called me back i called him on the weekend and made it clear that i want him to call me back  can he just ignore me,legal  regulatoryprofessional ethics,anxiety disorders,mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients  this is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller  in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youin addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards  for example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within  hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promiseall that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too it is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlyin the end i agree with sherrys advice if you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit
561,i always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people i know that no matter what i do or how i change there will always be some people who hate me  why do i feel this way,selfesteem,mood disorders,it is normal to seek others attention and noticing that some people would not be interested  after all we belong to a social environment where we constantly receive others feedback which at times validates us makes feel important and useful like we belong but also at times makes us feel isolated different and neglected which we could interpret as hatethe key is to be aware of what you think about what people think of you   got it  this part can be tricky at times because what others think about us does not really affect us what really affects us is what we decide to believe internalize and make our reality  for example i could choose to ignore a persons comment about me or i could decide to focus on it all day analyze why they said that and what have i done to them to get to that conclusion  eventually since we became so focused on that thought we may end up believing that what the other person said about us was true even if we did not agree to begin withso how can we fix this  awareness is the key  it is important that you understand the way you internalize external inputs like comments and to go through a process of discarding negative ones  it is also helpful to talk to your counselor about how you process feedback and validation so you learn to balance your positive traits from negatives and how that affects your relationships and selfesteemcómo me puede importar menos lo que la gente piensasiempre siento la necesidad de impresionar a otros ya sea mi familia la gente de la escuela o extraños  y sé que no importa lo que haga o cuanto haga siempre habrá personas que me odian  por qué me siento asíes común que busquemos la atención de otros y notemos que algunas personas no están interesadas  después de todo pertenecemos a un ambiente social donde constantemente recibimos comentarios que a veces nos validan alagan y nos hacen sentir como parte importante y funcional de la sociedad pero en otros momentos nos hacen sentir aislados ignorados y diferentes lo cual lo pudiéramos interpretar como odiola clave es estar conscientes de lo que pensamos que los otros piensan de nosotros me sigues  esta parte puede ser algo confusa porque lo que piensan otras personas de nosotros no nos afecta directamente lo que si nos afecta es lo que decidimos creer que otras personas piensan de nosotros y luego lo internalizamos y hacemos parte de nuestra vida  por ejemplo  podemos decidir ignorar lo que una persona dice de nosotros o podemos decidir enfocarnos en ello todo el día analizando en detalle porque lo dijeron y que hemos hecho para hacer que ellos piensen así eventualmente nos enfocamos tanto en ese pensamiento que terminamos creyendo que es verdad aun cuando originalmente no lo creíamos asíentonces como lo arreglamos la clave es concientización  es importante entender la manera en que internalizamos las opiniones de otros y que pasemos por un proceso de discriminación donde descartemos los comentarios negativos hasta que aprendamos a ignorarlos también ayudaría hablar con un consejero sobre como internamente validas y descartas los comentarios y opiniones externas y como eso puede estar afectando tus relaciones y tu autoestima

568,i blame my past relationship for it i know it is bad to be this way i want to get past it,relationships,anxiety disorders,how did you come to the conclusion that you are acting needyis this what your partner told you or are you feeling this way about yourselfthe difference is that what youd like from a relationship may be very reasonable only that your partner is not someone who wants to meet your needsone way of evaluating whether youre actually needy is whether you feel that you give yourself love take good care of yourself when youre in situations that are not connected to being part of a coupleif being by yourself feels uneasy most of the time then probably practicing selflove consciously treating yourself with consideration and thoughtfulness may help you feel less needy of othersthis way when youre with a partner the time together will be in enjoying the partner not getting love because of not figuring out a way of giving love to yourself
569,i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years i have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse can counseling help,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,"certainly counselling can help however there is a caveat namely you will need the right counsellor with the right approach this leads to two questions  what are the identifiers for the right counsellor and  what is the right approach what are the identifiers for the right counsellor the right counsellor will almost certainly have a lot of experience he or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist this person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges not as a diagnostic category he or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall the indepth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you the moment your overall life experience and their inthemoment experience it goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you value you as a human being and value the connection as well it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist gets you  what is the right approach  as carl jung stated when the doctor sits down with the patient he or 
she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person the approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to preverbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain nonordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human developmentdepression is generally experienced as the system shutting down anxiety is a signal that something is wrong anxiety is not the problem it is a sign that there is a problem the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and reinitiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage"
570,i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult i have panic attacks nightmares anger and at times depression i feel like im always on the edge or just apathetic  can i fix this by myself,trauma,mood disorders,when it comes to trauma especially in the event that it has caused you to develop ptsd there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as  weeks as for your other concerns many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through panic attacks and depression specifically often respond well to selfhelp treatment manuals the centre for clinical interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask
571,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,traumarelationships,mood disorders,a lot of times when youre experiencing nightmares and flashbacks it can be a sign that you havent fully processed what happened our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or  in an effort to desensitize us to it  if you are comfortable with it you may want to consider sharing what youre experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand whats going on also you may want to consider  what parts of your past relationship you blame yourself for this can be a difficult task to undertake on your own and the help of the therapist may be necessary to sort through the memories in a safe way  typically however flashbacks and nightmares are a sign that the trauma  of what you went through needs to be addressed  its a great thing that you were able to have the courage to get out of that relationship and you should be proud of yourself for that  you may want to  begin therapy to address these traumatic memories and help you to sort through any conflicting emotions you have about it ie  feeling like its your fault for not recognizing the abuse or getting out of the relationship sooner blaming yourself for being   the kind of person who gets into an abusive relationship   or believing that you somehow caused your ex to abuse you in some way  these types of beliefs and feelings can prevent us from moving past traumatic experiences and a trained therapist can certainly help you sort through them

573,im fine when we start becoming intimate but out of nowhere i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me,intimacytrauma,mood disorders,sexual intimacy can be very triggering for survivors even when it is both wanted and consensual  you may want to consider seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma to work through the abuse if you have not already done so often times triggers still hold such a powerful effect when the emotions related to the abuse  have not been fully processed  in the meantime you may want to consider coming up with a safe word to let your partner know that you are being triggered or to communicate your physical boundaries to him  often times the experience of communicating  your physical boundaries to your partner having those boundaries respected and validated and having a partner who is understanding and  willing to engage in intimacy in such a way that does not violate your physical boundaries  can reinforce a sense of safety with him
574,i have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years i have been on medication but lately my depression has felt worse can counseling help,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,my initial response  consider a more comprehensive mh assessment to determine other factors a medical evaluation is warranted to rule out poor health issues blood work is helpful review what hadnt helped
575,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,traumarelationships,mood disorders,ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse  if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true this negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship  the fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse  good for younightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories including associated beliefs emotions and physical sensations that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed  there are likely reminders called triggers of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences  this is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you  however you likely feel as if you are not in control    the goal is protect your current relationship evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings and begin working on healing your memories of abuse in many cases my use of emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories reduce or eliminate triggers bring healing and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship  i would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences your decision to pursue counseling and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship  with a good support network in place healing is very possible

583,is this something i should be worried about  should i do something about it,parenting,anxiety disorders,it can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships parents can usually tell when their child is happy but kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn a parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone a parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play if a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own i encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully use phrases like hey i noticed something or let me help you be successful by showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zonewhen to seek professional help when does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues true personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood still professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities also parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety the vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal if the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company

somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works nothing has changed and i feel hopeless any suggestions or ideas",family conflictselfesteem,mood disorders,it sounds like you are aware of your positive traits but you are struggling with someone who does not acknowledge nor celebrate your efforts or achievements   it seems like that is affecting your inner voice which allows you to accept yourself for who you aremy suggestion is to explore that relationship and decide if that persons opinion should determine how you feel about yourself   if this is an important relationship you could communicate to this person how the lack of positive feedback is affecting you  then work on spending more time with those who value you and can give you praise encouragement and constructive criticism  also explore your religious beliefs and what is they say about who you are as a person  finally explore with a counselor your inner voice and try to figure out if the negative message is settling in and harming your selfesteem   through therapy you could learn to selfcompassion and acceptance wich will help your self esteemcómo manejo el sentirme que no soy suficiente buenosiempre me dicen que no soy suficientemente bueno o no trato lo suficiente  yo pongo el  en todo  estoy agotado he trabajado en todas mis relaciones estoy muy bien en la escuela trato bien a las personas que lo necesitan  me aferro a mis creencias religiosas y dejo espacio para los errores y aprendo de otros para no tener que cometer los mismos  aun así no soy suficiente y nada de lo que hago funciona me siento desesperanzado  alguna idea o sugerenciaal parecer estas consiente de tus características positivas pero estás teniendo  dificultad con alguien que no reconoce tus esfuerzos ni logros y eso está afectando esa voz interior que te permite aceptar quien eresmi sugerencia es que explores esa relación y analices si la opinión de esta persona va a determinar cómo te valoras a ti mismo  si es una relación valiosa puedes comunicarle a la persona en cuestión como te afecta la falta de comentarios y opiniones positivas   luego enfócate en pasar más tiempo con personas que te valoran te dan halagos te motivan y te aconsejan  también explora que dice tu religión sobre quién eres como persona y cuál es tu valor  y por último explora con tu consejero si ese mensaje negativo esta afectando tu autoestima  a través de la terapia puedes aprender tecnicas auto compasión y aceptación que ayudaran a fortalecerte
586,i recently lost a friend to suicide  im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,grief and losssubstance abusetrauma,mood disorders,im so sorry to hear about your recent loss  there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and its never easy  i think its important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else  the fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time  marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions when it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty  the more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours the more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss in talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level writing a poem planting a tree etc or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc we never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us nowbut that also takes time
587,i recently lost a friend to suicide  im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,grief and losssubstance abusetrauma,mood disorders,let me begin by offering my condolences for your loss i can understand how difficult this time maybe for you especially if you have several unanswered the questions due to the circumstances surrounding the death of your friend  its during this time that you may experience the various stages of grief this includes denial anger bargaining depression and finally acceptance in the bereavement process there is so specific time frame or lengths of time for someone to work through each step its imperative to note  that one may express each stage with different levels of intensity also the five stages do not necessarily occur in any specific order we often move between stages before achieving a more peaceful acceptance of death just note that everyone greives differently some internalize their feelings and emotions others express it externally while other avoid it all togethercoping with loss is ultimately a deeply personal and singular experience sometimes we feel that no one understands what we are feeling or going through much less comprehend our emotional state of mind  whats important is that you allow others to comfort you through the various stages my recommendation is to allow yourself to go through the emotions and feel the grief avoiding or resisting may only delay the healing process reaching the acceptance stage of mourning is a gift not not everyone is awarded but seeking the help of a grief counselor may assist in deciphering your emotions and set you on a more positive path to achieve closer

602,is this something i should be worried about  should i do something about it,parenting,anxiety disorders,my son plays alone at recessis this something i should be worried about should i do something about itevery mom is the expert on their childrens behavior  first of all i suggest checking with your son asking him if he is happy while playing alone or does he complain that no one wants to play with him  does he plays alone in school but is social in other environments with family or neighborsplaying alone is healthy for children it helps them to be independent and confident it allows them to explore their environment and use their imagination among other benefits  on the other hand it is also important to develop social skills early on and become confident in our skills as we grow  children go through stages of exploration until they develop a sense of social confidence depending on your sons age he might need some input or advice  provide the opportunity to interact with other children without pushing it  take him to the park to play with a friend or to childrens activities in your neighborhood  later ask him what did he thought of the activity and if he enjoyed playing there  children also follow their parents model so you can encourage social interaction by greeting other and asking your son to do the same ask him to receive the guests who come to the house with you and sit to enjoy the conversation if you notice any shakiness becoming tearful anxious or aggressive when approaching social encounters you may want to talk to the school counselor or childrens therapist to evaluate those symptoms and rule out any behavioral problems or social anxietymi hijo juega solo en el recesodebería preocuparme al respecto  debería hacer algo al respectocada mama es experta en la conducta de sus hijos  primero que nada te sugiero que revises con tu hijo y le preguntes si él se siente contento jugando solo o si se queja porque nadie quiere jugar con él   observa si él juega solo en la escuela pero es sociable en otros ambientes como con la familia  o los vecinos jugar solo puede ser saludable para los niños les ayudo a ser independientes desarrollan sentido de seguridad y les permite explorar su ambiente y utilizar su imaginación entre otros beneficiospor otro lado también es importante desarrollar destrezas sociales y perfeccionarlas con la práctica   los niños van por etapas de exploración y prueba hasta que desarrollan un nivel de confianza en sus destrezas sociales  dependiendo de la edad de tu hijo puede que el necesite algunos consejos  provéele la oportunidad de interactuar con otros niños sin obligarlo ya sea yendo al parque a jugar con vecinos o a actividades comunitarias infantiles con algún amigo  luego pregúntale como le pareció la actividad y si le gusto compartir allí  también recuerda que los niños siguen el modelo de sus padres así que puedes motivarlo invitándolo a que salude a otros después de ti o invitándolo a recibir a la visita que llega a la casa y que los acompañe durante la conversaciónsi observas que tu hijo está nervioso lloroso o agresivo cuando se acerca alguna actividad social consulta con el consejero escolar o un consejero infantil para evaluar sus síntomas y descarta cualquier problema de conducta o ansiedad

605,is this something i should be worried about  should i do something about it,parenting,anxiety disorders,humans are social creatures so this can be an alarming thing for a parent to deal with just like adults children are not the same and some children are more social than others if he plays alone at recess all the time it would worry myself as well however recess is only one domain of life does he have friends outside of school or daycare does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs if this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on if perhaps it is occurring just during recess it could be something else altogether i would request reports from all teachers and caregivers concerning socialization and make a choice on whether or not to evaluate furtherhope this helpsc
606,i feel really uncomfortable when i have peoples attention  it makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class can i get over this social anxiety,anxietysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result or fear of being judged negatively as though having failed some sort of test consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audiencemaybe for example if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would youd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audienceonce you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort it may feel more manageableyes social anxiety can change  you may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audienceand it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you
607,i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,social relationshipsdepression,mood disorders,there is a difference in someone agreeing to try something and agreeing to continue to do it have you ever been willing to try something and then decided you did not like it a type of food a sport a new restaurant a type of dance so this does not mean that things have changed between you it does mean that the two of you may need to spend some time to find out what you both like instead of looking at it as a rejection look at it as a challenge an adventure that the two of you can go on as explorers together some couples have even found it helpful to each write down ten things they would like the other person to try and then each person can pick three things from the other persons list to add into their life together when they chose to over the next few weeks
608,i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,social relationshipsdepression,mood disorders,there are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties even medical illness  for some even grief creates a sense of isolation pains from relationship break up  also obsessive thinking can be debilitating  seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support  some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this even if not talking directly on issues just being around another is positive  obviously there is more to explore on this question given minimal information from two sentences
609,ive felt this way for  two years i feel so much better now then i did when it started but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,best answer that i can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone it will come and go throughout life kind of like being on a rollercoaster here it is then its gone not to return for quite some time like many things the more that you fixate on it the more stress it will cause you consider it part of life accept it and move on now if your having many many many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at but for the most part nothing to worry about hope this helpsc
610,i have a lot on my mind but all i want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone why do i feel so alone,social relationshipsdepression,mood disorders,it has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal  often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue for some depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief  when there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety depression is often the result  in this type of case depression is not the main or underlying issue the anxiety is the underlying issue  having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness  in the question above i would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from has there been ongoing rejection from peers from family if so why does this seem to be happening  isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain where does that need to protect originate  are there unmet needs from childhood are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism we can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party  this has nothing in this case to do with being around people it has more to do with how we view ourselves  if there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says you are worth nothing or you dont deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it i would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time the developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs if there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma  looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy
611,i have no friends no hobbies and no interest in anything i get annoyed with everything and everyone i am always tired i can sleep  hrs or  hrs and im still tired  i dont know what to do is this normal,depression,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question it certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going here are a few thoughts and ideas if you havent seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to there are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age it doesnt hurt to get checked out if they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms in addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression so dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors you may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression a counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place this could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things  finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal these symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition it is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that you are millions of people struggle with depression so remember the symptoms are the problem not you hope this helps be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
612,im a guy if i dont like girls nor do i like guys does that mean im gay,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,hi and thanks for your question i agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality but i want too add a couple of things about thathere is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality  httpwwwasexualityorghomethere are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality one is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex and that is not always the case there are variations of asexuality some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others dont also once you read more on this topic you may find that you dont connect with asexuality either and that is okay our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight gay lesbian or bisexual but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations keep exploring there is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do finally labels are important for a lot of things but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly this is your journey your experience take all the time you need you may never feel the need to label how you feel and that is okay too hope this helps be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
613,its really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who dont put any effort into nourishing our relationship,social relationships,anxiety disorders,one thing i would ask is why are you still hanging with those friends a relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people i would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends i always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved if your in a relationship that is onesided it is inevitable that it will start to decompensate never travel with the circus never travel with fools everything in life should have some positive payout will things at times be negative of course they will but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativityhope this helps c
614,i was in a relationship for almost five years we were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship he was a caring friendly and charming guy up until three and a half years in he started controlling me who i hung out with where i was at all times and he had a huge hissy fit if i tried to ask him the same questions all that time he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my socalled friends at the end he was a nasty and narcissistic person now its hard to be social,relationship dissolution social relationships,mood disorders,it sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people it is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with otherstherapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want often relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship
615,"ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost  years even though i care about him he continues to hurt me 

he and his wife were separated when we met now hes going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard  i want to end this relationship but i dont feel like i can how can i let go",relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question boy ending relationships is tough isnt it sometimes its tough even when we are  sure that it is the right thing to doi am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others one of the things that i want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing in other words its not really something you can reach out and grab its more of a process this is good news because you dont necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship we just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over for example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their anniversary this could make the person very sad they may even regret ending the relationship for a little while it would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it this is relevant for you its hard to walk away from a relationship we fear all kinds of things including being single sometimes its helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship its helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship its fine to admit uncertainly about ending things its okay to be afraid its okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt and even with all of that someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them they can have sadness later on and still not go backit sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce the truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship there would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce sometimes not making decisions stresses us out a lot more than making a decision and living with the consequences both good and bad you may be at that crossroads be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
616,after i told them they yelled at me,lgbtqfamily conflict,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family i truly wish i could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately i cant do that their acceptance of you is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen so here are a few things i would suggestsurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are that wont take the place of your familys acceptance and i wont even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most and that is really important patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some when families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock and then sometimes even grieving they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden these things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience if it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away i do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around they may or they may not and if they dont you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that if you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with counselor may be a great idea i am bias probably but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good idea  hope this helps be well be you robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

673,im in my early s and ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now my boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently he has made comments such as you would look better as a tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats its really hurtful,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that you are experiencing this to be honest this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive and you likely know that already the unfortunate truth is there is very little we can actually do to change another adults behavior if they are not interested in changing it many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say or even believe that they are helping in some way by telling you how to improve yourself what is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive it is important to know that this kind of behavior doesnt necessarily show up right away that is why i am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors some people actually dont see them until they are already married you didnt mention that there has been any physical abuse but i would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with what you do and how you dress etc these are just more examples of emotional abuse and control here are some things to consider and some ideas you could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior if you believe it is safe to do so perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay and change if not then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship given the fact that you cannot force him to change  you can call a local domestic violence program they do not only work with people who have been physically abused or have been married they are trained to talk about emotional abuse also it may be a good thing for support your calls are confidential  check out the wheel in the link below on it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship if any of these are happening to you or begin to happen talking to a domestic violence program a trusted friend or family member or a counselor would be a good idea httpwwwdomesticviolencewilmorgportalsimagesviolence_wheelgif  be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

694,my fiancée is always letting me know how i am a horribleevil person or i just dont care enough when its about her feeling or when she is having an off day,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,one thing you could try is to have a conversation when neither of you is upset so that you learn what makes each of you feel cared for and valued it could be that you are showing caring in a way that doesnt quite match what she is really looking for in that moment for example having an indepth conversation could be something that you want but she may just want a hug in that moment i dont know if you heard of gary chapmans book about love languages but it may be helpful
695,i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancée,depressionrelationships,mood disorders,sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreementyou could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancée is open to thatsomething else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree ahead of time that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time usually about an hour and then try to resume the discussion the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts though
696,i stopped for a while but ive started doing it again its like an addiction the more i try to stop the more i want to do it ive tried doing some of the stuff they say to do like draw but it doesnt work,depression,mood disorders,ive heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions youre also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting it becomes more difficult because its what you are focused on while that is still something to work on it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead you said drawing doesnt work for you sometimes more physical activities such as doing a few jumping jacks can be helpful if you dont exercise it might be something to talk with your doctor about firstthe more you can learn about what makes you want to cut the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut
697,when im sad and alone i want to cut myself,depression,mood disorders,try doing something physical if you havent exercised before it is a good idea to get your doctors approval first but this can be helpfulthe more you can find out about when you want to cut the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do if you are feeling sad or angry or nervous look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about thatyou said you are alone i would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through this could be a parent a friend someone at school a coworker or any number of other people
698,she has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and im her caregiver all she does is complain hit me call me names and say things happened that didnt when i tell her she explodes i didnt always hate her but now every little thing she does irritates me and i dont have the means to live on my own,family conflict,mood disorders,it sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating hersomething you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom i dont know how old your mom is but if she is younger they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help if you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together do you think your mom is able to actually recognize how what she does and says affects youfrom whom do you have support during all of this
699,she works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,i wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about this can often change the way that we look at different situations try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings beforeif you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you then you could talk about feelings that youre having
700,i get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two it usually happens in bed at night but i occasionally experience this during the day i have a benign brain tumor but the doctor said it is not associated with this,behavioral changesleep improvement,anxiety disorders,im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening i know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature as far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on these are just some thoughts but i think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start
701,i know i was molested as a child but i have no memory of it,trauma,mood disorders,im not sure that i have the answer to your question but i can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist there are a list of them here httpwwwnatboardcomindex_filespagehtm you also may want to talk to someone who specializes in emdr this stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment i am not trained in this particular method but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started
702,i think i may suffer from depression and it is affecting my life and sleep i am on my parents insurance and they wont let me see a therapist because they dont believe in it,family conflictdepression,mood disorders,the answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live in pennsylvania anyone over the age of  can provide consent for their own treatment as for billing purposes try talking to some local agencies if you are under  you may be able to have medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment if you are over  there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation youre in maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agenciesif you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school this would not require using your insurance

721,i try to do everything right just so we wont argue and it doesnt help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol i get anxiety over having fights with him,relationships,anxiety disorders,because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fightswhen you do everything right are you saying that you dont argue it sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively i recommend working on this with a therapist though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm

730,we have been together over a year we spend time together every day no matter how busy he started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight he also began to be distant and sexually selfish we had a argument and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer he wont treat it,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,i wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want wish for and desire from one another right now that doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wantsyou may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one anotheri would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends with him considering doing the same so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone elseit may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones

736,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spiritualitysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,your question is actually thoughtful and reflects a true interest to know more about lifeno one knows if god is a lie because god is a concept in which people either make up their own definition of this concept or believe one of the concepts of what god is handed down by religionsall the religions exclude the other god concepts and expect loyalty to believing in their particular version of godprobably god is real in the sense that most people want to believe there is guided purpose to what goes on in lifethis is as definite as what we can know about godgod is not a lie because it is not a fact  beliefs arent provable
737,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spiritualitysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,it is not a stupid question it is very basic to help answer your question let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof with that being said one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly if one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable then there must be a guiding force and plan  may you be successful in your journey
738,i was a victim of an incident ive been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because i dont feel anyone honestly believes me there are so many other factors i deal with on a daily basis i ignore my problems when im with my friends but its scary when im alone,trauma,mood disorders,as you seemed to have learned the impact will not just go away treatment of trauma is like surgery it requires a skillful clinician to help resolve it while you are contemplating getting help you can focus on calming techniques like meditation and yoga they will aid you when you begin the therapeutic process
739,im in my late s i have two jobs right now im in school and i feel like i just have a lot under my belt right now i get stressed out really easily i tend to worry and overthink im just worried about money and everything,stress,stressrelated disorders,a good start is to pay attention to some basic issues sleep nutrition exercise and socially supportive relationships a great car on an empty tank will not get you very far
740,im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about  think about it for a minute  do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female coworkers your husband has  and if so what does that say about your marriage  trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with its also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common  if you are focused on every little detail around your relationship it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more   if instead you focus on opening the lines of communication let him know what you expect from him and discuss how you could both build trust again you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow  debería este molesta porque mi esposo me mintió de nuevoestoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione después de una separación  antes de separarnos el mentía mucho y rompía todas sus promesas  no creo que me haya sido infiel  el mes pasado le pregunté cuantas mujeres trabajan con él y él me dijo  ayer me enteré que se olvido de una muchacha  debería estar enojadaquieres estar molesta porque se le olvido con cuantas mujeres trabaja  piénsalo por un momento  quieres determinar la confianza que le tienes en tu esposo basándote en su capacidad de reportar la cantidad de mujeres que trabajan con él  si tu respuesta es sí qué refleja eso sobre tu matrimonio  la confianza es algo que se gana basado en nuestras acciones y las de aquellos con quienes interactuamos también en nuestra habilidad de comunicar y entender los valores que tenemos en común si practicas estar preocupada por cada pequeño detalle en tu relación esto se puede convertir en una obsesión que potencialmente dañara tu relación  si en cambio te enfocas en abrir las líneas de comunicación le dejas saber lo que esperas de él y discuten cómo pueden trabajar juntos para recuperar la confianza pueden volverse más cercanos y darse la oportunidad de que la relación crezca
741,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spiritualitysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,thanks for posting  this is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless among other emotions due to the uncertainty  you said that at times you feel like everyone is lying ask yourself some of these questions  what is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying  where is the concrete evidence that they are lying how could i test my thoughts about this what if things are not what they seem on the surface am i any lesser of a person as a result of this persons behavior or opinion  our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world  and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave  it is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions  you can start this process by answering some of the above questions  we are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with  as it pertains to if god is a lie be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that god is or is not real  it may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that  hope this helps at least a little bit
742,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,thank you for posting  im interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to schoolemployedunemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself  often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion  there are typically points in the day even if it is for only in  minute intervals when we do not feel that negative emotion  when we overgeneralize we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you  ask yourself some of these questions am i being realistic when im overgeneralizing things have i ever noticed a short period of time that i wasnt feeling anxious  what do i notice when i am feeling anxious what am i thinking about  when was the last time i felt empathy  what was different when i was able to feel empathy  hopefully this helps get you started
743,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spiritualitysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,there are an infinite number of ways to look at this spirituality religion god higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people my question for you is what does real actually mean to you often the concept of god has to do with what you believe in if you ask  different people youll probably get almost that many different answersconsider talking with friends or family about this i would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do you may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure the local salvation army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services there may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussionjust a word of caution in my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others when initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinionsas far as whether god is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process
744,i have known i was always different this year in december i found out that i never felt female i did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad,family conflictlgbtq,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question this is certainly a tough spot i have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things you may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues or if you have ever heard him talk about it that may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you for example if he has been watching the news lately transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot has he had an opinion this wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people to tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you there is no right or wrong way best or worst if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him thats perfect want to have a friend with you for support equally perfect whatever thing you need to do and of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so unfortunately the response from your dad cant be predicted some parents are totally cool others not so much this is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea if things get heated you have someone in your corner there are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him you can also google some stories about how others came outi refer many people to the wwwletsqueerthingsupcom blog it is a popular blog written by a trans man that i know he writes on many topics related to trans issues hope some of these suggestions help be well be you and good luckrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
745,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spiritualitysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,the way that i see it is that humans have always been afraid of life and death historically we have always tried to understand life we try to organize it categorize it explore it and weve built up this system our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and death is this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements it is no matter how you try to argue it a false system of conditioning humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be god has been developed over time as a security blanket for our childlike selves the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way on earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought economics societal structures and so on it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at baskinrobbins so then i ask you which one is real and what is real
746,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,"empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life 
it is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature
if you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety  but i wonder
if instead of feeling empathy you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety  a good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react sera normal que no sienta empatíaparece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad ni si quiera por mí misma empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que
ellos experimentan la vida  es una
destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas  si te estás sintiendo
ansioso tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad  pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad  una buena manera es estar consciente
que activa la ansiedad y ya que lo identifiques explora que otras reacciones
pudieras tener"
747,im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this,marriageintimacyhuman sexuality,mood disorders,this could have many different origins have you tried asking him about it sometimes starting with asking whether he would be open to having an important discussion can be a good beginning if that starts well perhaps continuing with something like ive noticed that we havent been together intimately or whatever phrasing works for you as much lately can you tell me more about what its like for youwhen asking questions like this it usually helpful to not overuse and perhaps try to avoid using the word why that word tends to trigger really strong emotional reactions in people try starting with what makes instead for example what made you choose not to do that
748,i was born a girl i look like a boy i sometimes feel like a different variation of gender i dont know what to say if someone asks my gender i just get really confused and usually say my birth gender,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,if youre feeling like your gender is different than the gender you are born with and there are many different terms to help describe that gender is actually looked at on a spectrum transgender is just one of those terms but looking at the information here may help httpwwwtransequalityorgabouttransgender im not saying that you should use the term transgender to describe yourself because that may not accurately describe what you are experiencing but im just trying to point you to some more resourcesas for what to say to someone who asks your gender that becomes a question with a lot of different parts this is probably something that would be best talked out with someone else who you trust i dont know whether that is your family friends and mental health professional and member of the clergy or someone else there are many different things than you could say and they are all related to how much you already to share with other people about how you feel regarding your gendergenerally i would suggest it would be important to become comfortable with how you feel yourself and possibly tell some people whom you really trust first also consider that once you tell someone something its not possible to undo it so if you tell someone they may tell someone else then there is also the matter of people having very different reactions related to different genders and not everyone will be supportive i hope that you are able to surround yourself with some people who are willing to understand and work through this with you so that you have some ideas how to react if you come across someone who does not understandplease remember that there is always someone to talk with

763,for the past four weeks ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things theyre not random voices but rather the voices of those i care about,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,voices and dreams could be suppressed feelings or thoughts that result from negative experiences  many times when people go to trough traumatic incidents or changes in their lives without being equipped to manage them and as a result they start having similar symptoms it is helpful to find a therapist to talk to about those dreams and voices once you get them out you could analyze the concerns and fears that they reflect and normalize them which will also be a good time to discuss their source if any traumatic event has occurred in your life  also i recommend to journal your dreams especially if they keep you awake at night and meditate after so you could go back to sleep   cómo puedo hacer que los sueños y las voces desaparezcandurante las últimas cuatro semanas he estado teniendo pesadillas y escuchando voces que me dicen cosas horribles  no son voces que hablan al azar pero voces de las personas que me importanlas voces y los sueños pueden ser sentimientos supresos o pensamientos que resultan de experiencias negativas  muchas veces estos síntomas surgen cuando las personas pasan por situaciones traumáticas o cambios que no estaban preparados para enfrentar  es útil encontrar a un terapeuta con quien puedas hablar de esos sueños y voces y aprender a normalizar el contenido de los mismos  también sería un buen momento para discutir cualquier situación traumática que te haya ocurrido además te sugiero que escribas tus sueños especialmente si te mantienen despierto  en la noche y que medites luego de escribirlos para que puedas volver a dormir
764,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,mood disorders,first i think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing  you are putting yourself out there and becoming a water safety instructor   we often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive  next you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment  whether or not it was malicious on his part i think the important thing to focus on is what is called common humanity  common humanity is one of the three elements of selfcompassion  common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience  while you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day  we all have embarrassing moments  when we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering  additionally another element to selfcompassion is selfkindness  my question is why must you forgive yourself  rather be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent
765,i am so terrified of having sex anymore because i have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection my partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex and honestly i want to give that to her,anxietyhuman sexualityintimacyrelationships,anxiety disorders,"i am wondering who is telling you that sex is dangerous  is this medical advice or is this someones
opinion trying to scare you from having sex 
and if so how old are you is it ok to have sex do you want to have
sex  it sounds like you want to make
your partner happy and that you are taking care of protecting yourself and
your partner but maybe you are forgetting to consider what do you really want  having sexual relations is a very personal decision
you and your partner have to consent  it
is also important to talk about the possible consequences and being responsible
for them as well  but sex should be something
that you enjoy not that you should be fearful of  a therapist can help you to process those
negative thoughts and feelings that may impair you from enjoying your sexual
life cómo puedo superar mi miedo de un
embarazo no deseado y poder tener sexo otra vezestoy
aterrorizado de tener sexo porque me han dicho una y otra vez que el sexo es
peligroso inclusive cuando yo y mi pareja usamos dos métodos de protección  mi pareja no está contenta y simplemente
quiere más sexo y honestamente yo quiero darle lo que ella quiereme pregunto quién
te está diciendo que el sexo es peligroso 
esto es aviso medico o es alguien intentando asustarte para que no
tengas relaciones  y si es así que
edad tienes  es apropiado que tengas
sexo a tu edad  quieres tener sexo me
parece que estas enfocado en hacer feliz a tu pareja y te estás protegiendo y protegiéndola
pero tal vez están olvidando analizar que tu quieres realmente  recuerda que tener una relación sexual es una
decisión personal en la que tú y tu pareja deben de estar de acuerdo   también es importante hablar de las posibles
consecuencias de tener relaciones como un embarazo y discutir sus opciones e
intenciones si eso ocurriera  ya que
han tenido comunicación al respecto el sexo debe ser algo que disfruten  no que temen 
un terapista te puede ayudar a procesar esos pensamientos negativos y
los sentimientos que te pudieran impedir disfrutar de tu vida sexual"
766,he said he would try and he never did its been nine months and this is making me worse today he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes is that true am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out,relationship dissolution depression,mood disorders,the fact that you mention that he is constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out suggests that discernment counseling might be a really good fit for you both discernment counseling is a protocol for partners where one or both arent certain they want to remain in the relationship its a brief  sessions and intentionally focused on helping partners talk through primarily individually their reasons for and against staying in the relationship  as well as confront their own contributions that lead to the relationship crisis its aimed at helping the couple reach a clear understanding of which path they are going to take not asking anyone to change just yet so it can be a lot less intimidating and more to the point than couples therapy  you can look to find a local therapist providing this service here that said i agree with other respondents that if he is deciding to leave seeking out support for yourself would be incredibly helpful you may need to accept his decision but you can certainly feel whatever emotions you have  you are allowed to feel exactly how you feel and its likely youll be sad or angry or hurt or disappointed or scared or any combination of anyall of those having someone there who can validate those emotions and help you to process the grief that naturally comes with the end of a relationship can be a huge help in finding a place of healing and regaining a sense of self a sense of hope
767,ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,anxietycareer counseling,anxiety disorders,theres a quote i love that says wherever you go there you are and the book by the same name by jon kabatzinn may be very helpful for you the thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often arent the things that need changing the awesome and challenging thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be through this deeper work you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself if you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist id recommend looking for someone offering acceptance and commitment therapy act or mindfulnessbased cognitive behavioral therapy mcbt also helpful may be the online program of mindfulness based stress reduction msbr found here there are inperson programs across the country but this online selfguided version is free and a great resource
768,ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,anxietycareer counseling,anxiety disorders,sometimes changes make sense it may be helpful to talk to someone who you trust to get a sense of whether the changes that you are making are those that are considered adaptable or important changes that allow us all to grow another possibility is that you are changing things in an effort to get away from something that is uncomfortable or difficult there are many other possibilities along this continuumi would ask you to consider the followingwhat is leading you to want to change your jobwhat feelings are associated with this change happy sad scared anxiousnervous confused motivated etchow is the job that you are looking to transfer to going to be better or different are the concerns that you have now going to travel with youif you are hesitating to get another perspective from trusted friends or family or some sort of career advisor in your area where is the hesitation coming from
769,for the past four weeks ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things theyre not random voices but rather the voices of those i care about,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,i would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going throughi dont know if you can understand when the voices are saying but i wonder how you feel about what you are hearing if the voices are just at night is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream if you recall your nightmares consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patternsone thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room youre in for example take time to notice your feet on the floor hips in the chair and shoulders against the back of the chair you can also try mindfulness techniques such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns these ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near youthanks for reaching out
770,i am so terrified of having sex anymore because i have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection my partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex and honestly i want to give that to her,anxietyhuman sexualityintimacyrelationships,anxiety disorders,i would suggest possibly talking with a physician about all the different types of protection they may be able to help you to know about all of the options that are availableit sounds like your partner is open to understanding your concerns perhaps until you have the chance to speak with someone about the effectiveness of different contraception and forms of protection are either of you open to other forms of engaging in sexual intimacy without penetration but with use of vibrators toys designed for sexual interactions etc
771,i have cheated on my husband of five years roughly ten times i pretend we arent married at my work recently he has caught on but i lie to cover it he use to talk to girls online but i have caught myself constantly having a affair,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,it may be helpful to have this emotionally impactful conversation in the context of couples therapywhether or not you should get a divorce is not the first question that comes to mind for me but more along the lines of do you want to be together and what kind of relationship do you want to createfor some people polyamorous relationships those involving more than two people are acceptable this does not work for everyone but if each of you agree that that is okay it may work for you and your husband if it is something that you are both open to it is often beneficial to have more than one discussion about the details of what is acceptable for each of youif you want to be devoted only to each other what does that lifestyle look like for each of you what can you start or stop doing right now to move your relationship in that directionneither of you can make the other partner change that does not mean you cannot talk about what each of your goals are together and support each other in working toward those goals you have for yourselvessometime having discussions like these is easier when there is a structure andor someone in the room like a therapist who can help keep the conversation on topic and work on having each of you communicate in a way that expresses your wants wishes and desires in a way that is not blaming of your partnerif either of you wants a divorce that could be part of the discussion divorce is not the only choice here depending upon what each of you wants and is willing to accept learn and grow from as it relates to yourself and your partner
772,how can i get to a place where i can be content from day to day,depression,mood disorders,one thing that comes to mind is making a list of some things that happen each day it could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are but because so many other things are going on you may not noticeanother idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day this way when youre having a rough day you have a list to think of and take a look atare you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you typically at least two meals per day and roughly  hours of sleep that night may be different depending on your age these two ideas are closely related to changes in your moodfrom where do you have support friends or familycan you take  or  minutes per day to do something that you enjoyif you think back to the last time that you felt content what was contributing to thatanother possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day for example rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break consider actually tasting it and enjoying it also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well for example when you finish your paperwork take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your email reading five pages of a book or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task
773,i have anxieties about everyday stressors ie finances work relationships kids and maintaining a household,anxietystress,anxiety disorders,something to remember about anxiety is that its a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first id recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for  seconds and then out for  seconds try to repeat this for  minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible  combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful if you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms
774,i have bipolar disorder paranoid personality disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety and obsessivecompulsive disorder i last selfharmed a week ago when i am stressed overwhelmed hurt or angry the urge to selfharm is all i can think of i am trying to seek help,anxietydepressionbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting  though  to be honest that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety however many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings  particularly those which offer a treatment called dialectical behavioral therapy dbt looking for a dbt professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions without knowing your location i also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline the volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when youre feeling overwhelmed

776,i have suffered many things at home and school we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing i try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman,relationshipsbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,there are a lot of ways to look at this it sounds as if there is a part of you that is looking for support i wonder what it is that you feel when youre not in a relationshipbecause of the way you asked the question im getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships i wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner having friends is still an important elementi wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself as far as emotions when you move from not being in a relationship to being in oneperhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourselfin general it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others in this case relationship has many meanings and degrees most of us enjoy sharing elements of our days thoughts feelings etc with someone else who we trust and care about  also hoping they care about us in return
777,a year ago the love of my life left me and never looked back our son was two months old at the time and it broke my heart i miss her so much and cant seem to get over  being so heartbroken,relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,i recognize that you say you are missing being with the love of your life at the same time i dont understand whether you are able to see your son im curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your sons motherwhen you say that she never looked back i imagine you are conveying that getting back together is not something that she is interested ini would suggest that you talk with a therapist and your local area so that you have the ability to discuss the loss of this person who you love so much most people think of grief related to the loss of someone who has died but it also applies to people who have a significant loss whether that is a relationship a job or any number of other thingsin the meantime try finding something about yourself that you value and can focus on
778,i stress over everything if i dont have enough quality time with my boyfriend i start to feel resentment towards him he has three children and they are great kids but i find we dont have much time together i break down easily and find myself depressed,anxietydepressionstressrelationships,anxiety disorders,everyone has some level of anxiety  its what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on however if youre feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all and youre starting to find that its getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want then id suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety your other concerns though seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children as a married stepmother ive been there and as a therapist i can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you arent alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics  because even if youre not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved you may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership
779,"i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year he recently got a new job and travels a lot im not used to him being gone all the time i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to
i feel lost sad and unwanted this is really a tough new challenge i just want to break up with him but i love him so much i dont know why he is acting this way lately i believe i have separation anxiety is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town",anxietyrelationships,anxiety disorders,relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard it makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship and youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling it can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible if you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feelingas far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but i highly recommend an app called selfhelp for anxiety management theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety the best part is its free

781,im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do,relationshipsintimacylgbtq,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question when faced with these kinds of difficult challenges i usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions what kind of person do i want to be deep in my heart what kind of character do i want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching how would i want others to describe me lets say that you want others to see you as being authentic and you also value authenticity as something you want to live by you may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now that you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart this is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation so please try not to feel alone we all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc and i am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a very hard time accepting themselves thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but i wont lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time for example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove that may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity it may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them i would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are both as an individual and as someones fiancéabove all i wish you well in this journey robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
782,i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,parenting,anxiety disorders,children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with childreni would also wonder where she is getting this idea sometimes children hear things on tv or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are rememberingit may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking forim curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry does she say the same sorts of things about youit may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well
783,i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,anxietyselfesteem,anxiety disorders,i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to i dont know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirablethere is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex performancerelated or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular personhaving sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability if your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itselfif this feels pretty structured it is initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationshipif this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships
784,both of my parents committed suicide together and i was the one who found them i suffer from overwhelming depression which is having an extreme effect on me and my husbands sex lives he does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex,traumadepressionrelationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question first i want to tell you how sorry i am for the experience you had with your parents that is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives it may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there so for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress trauma or grief if your husband will agree to it couples counseling may be your best bet a counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy if he doesnt agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own you still have a lot you are dealing with yourself and sometimes our personally therapy can influence others so it may be a good idea it is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it i hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
785,i have suffered many things at home and school we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing i try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman,relationshipsbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,there could be many reasons but often people feel validated when they are in a relationship the need to be in a relationship can be related to a belief of unlovability which often stems from our childhood the relationship sort of soothes this temporarily and the others interest or desire helps counteract the ingrained belief there are many questions that may help understand why how was your relationship with your mother caregivers  how was your childhood etc many people describe having a hole or void they try and fill with material things or people but it only is a temporary fix which usually drives the person to the next relationship or object in hopes it will be fulfilling but it never is because fulfillment is work we need to do ourselves this journey involves finding acceptance and love for ourselves once we have that we dont need to look elsewhere for fulfillment
786,ive been on  mg of xanax twice a day for the past month it hasnt been helping me at all but when i take  mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to  mg twice a day without her thinking im abusing them i just have very big anxiety attacks should i stay on the mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,anxiety,anxiety disorders,hello and thank you for your question while counselors work closely with medical providers and sometimes have discussions about medications with people we rarely make recommendations about how much or what type of medication a person should be taking this is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice the only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician nurse practitioner physicians assistant etc having said that i certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with if you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks you should consider it medications can be helpful for anxiety and medications like xanax may help for immediate relief but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety longterm therapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with exposure therapy has good outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks if you are interested in speaking with your provider about the xanax i think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine the provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication please remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time medications like xanax really are highly addictive the more you take the more you may feel you need the more often you may feel you need to use it depending on the frequency and amount of use some people suffer serious withdrawal symptoms when they do not take the medication it is a good idea to talk to medical provider about all of those things so that you can partner on right course of action to manage this anxiety i certainly hope that you get some relief i know anxiety is awfulrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
787,sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost  minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,anxiety,anxiety disorders,it is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder there isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen whats going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general anxiety itself is a really natural thing  its just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders it might be that for the most part the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms this twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way youd like
788,i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,depressionanxietysleep improvement,anxiety disorders,it could be really helpful to see a counselortherapist about your increasing depressionpanic symptoms finding out the cause of depressionanxiety isnt always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason for example if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically ill start to see a lot more that i get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself same with anxiety obviously this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained but thats where working with a counselortherapist comes in i would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic and if you can through the panic attack continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations youre feeling  such as saying to yourself okay im breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight reminding yourself that its just your bodys reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now youre okay and eventually it will go away i highly recommend the sam for anxiety management app for the anxiety piece and i wouldnt be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too
789,her father and i have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now she is an adolescent and the problem is mostly food she is now overweight and we just dont know what to do anymore she can be disrespectful and doesnt listen to or respect what we say,parenting,anxiety disorders,i would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury the fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning i would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment they may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue
790,im in my late s i never loved or have been loved i need deeper help than is offered in my small town but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia i find myself losing hope more and more my brain barely works anymore and my memory so small i forget in a moment i serve no purpose im incapable of work or anything of value and i never have been im a complete waste of time and resources and yet i keep trying why why does god insist that i continue to exist im not suicidal just tired,selfesteemdepressionanxiety,anxiety disorders,the fact that youre reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different and that drive might be something worth tapping into why do i keep trying is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you going a lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy as long as youre in the same state as a therapist offering this service you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home even being in your small town id recommend looking into this option because youre asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers
791,"i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year he recently got a new job and travels a lot im not used to him being gone all the time i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to
i feel lost sad and unwanted this is really a tough new challenge i just want to break up with him but i love him so much i dont know why he is acting this way lately i believe i have separation anxiety is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town",anxietyrelationships,anxiety disorders,consider talking with your boyfriend about times that you may be able to talk together while he is away this way you have an idea when youll be able to contact him does he recognize the feelings that you have while he is away how do you feel when you are together with him and he is homeim also curious as to how the level of your anxiety on a scale of  to  perhaps changes during the parts of his trips maybe there are certain parts that are more or less related to anxiety for you perhaps you have less anxiety while working or involved in a specific activity for example spending time with friendswhen you are both in the same area when your boyfriend is not traveling do you do some things independently with friends do you know what leads to your anxiety when he is away i dont know whether it is a general feeling of wanting him to come back or anxiety that something specific will happen to you or himdo you ever recall feeling this way in your past if so what was happening thenwhat do you have that makes you feel very safe and comfortableconsider working with a mental health professional in the area perhaps it would be helpful for the two of you to meet with a therapist who specializes in couples to see what kind of relationship you want to have and what you can each do to contribute to that relationship there could be things that you could both start or stop doing to help your relationship move in the direction where you would like it to go as an example perhaps you would like a text before your boyfriend goes to bed no matter what time zone or time of day it is perhaps he would prefer a good morning text or callvoicemail from you
792,sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost  minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,anxiety,anxiety disorders,first be aware that each end every one of us has anxiety at some point that certainly seems to fit what youre describing here but that doesnt mean you have an anxiety disorder necessarily thats where there is a difference anyone who has a hard time with public speaking or feels uncomfortable in large crowds for example is experiencing anxietyit sounds like it would be helpful to look at the differences between the days when you are more comfortable on the days that you are not if you notice your anxiety is keeping you from doing things that you need or want to do it may be helpful to talk with and mental health professionali wonder also whether your appetite and sleeping patterns are the same or similar to how they were before you experienced this anxiety when your anxiety started and whether you feel more comfortable when someone you trust is there with youif you have an idea of times or situations in which you feel anxious consider carrying a small smooth rock or another object that makes you feel calm and centered perhaps you can keep it in your pocket and remember specific comfortable times while you have it in your hand

794,im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do,relationshipsintimacylgbtq,mood disorders,if you are happy with the person that you are about to be married to and are also enjoying time with other men it could be possible that you are attracted to people of more than one genderhaving said that some people have feelings toward people of more than one gender that are not really related to romance or attraction but any number of other feelings such as trust and communication i dont know whether your use of the phrase messing around was related specifically to being romantically or sexually involved with the people who you are or referring to or if you are saying that you are enjoying spending time with them these terms have different definitions for almost everyonei would definitely recommend speaking with a local mental health practitioner in your area not because there is anything wrong about the way you are feeling but because there are a lot of different parts of what is happening in your life right now and it may be helpful to talk about the feelings and thoughts with someone who can help you to learn more about yourself and the people are most important in your life yourself includedi also suggest looking at a few things that you love and appreciate about yourself
795,he wants to wear makeup and heels he even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina he wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him i have tried this for him but i dont like it and have told him so he keeps making comments about it and says he cant live without it,marriagehuman sexualitylgbtq,mood disorders,it sounds like you may be asking two different questionswith regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom i wonder if you would consider asking him more about this if you choose to do that i would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience this can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion it may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly if what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing i also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over timeyou could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are havingas far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you dont like andor understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here it depends on what you both preferthese types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially having structured conversations such as the ones ive described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argumentalso consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas
796,sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost  minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,anxiety,anxiety disorders,your sitting in your car for  minutes story sounds so sad and frustratingyes youre describing classic symptoms of anxietyanxiety itself is the indirect result of repeatedly being in positions of feeling helpless or frightenedare you able to recall from your growing up years of feeling insecureyou may not have felt loved and nurtured as much as you neededsome people develop anxiety from missing enough love  they feel lacking in ability to take care of themselves similar to the lack of being sufficiently taken care of when youngertry understanding if you felt neglected emotionallyif yes then start the slow process of emotionally rewarding and acknowledging yourselfprogress will be sloweventually youll stabilize the way you feel toward yourselfthis will gradually result in decreased anxiety
797,i have known i was always different this year in december i found out that i never felt female i did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad,family conflictlgbtq,mood disorders,i admire your courageif you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity i would suggest a couple of things there are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now i dont mean to convey that everyone thinks feels or acts the same by any means but rather that it may be helpful to talk to others who have had some similar experiencesi was trying to include some links for you but that particular button isnt functioning window if you search for transgender support on google youll find glaad and pflag both of which are national organizations this does not mean that you have to identify as transgender but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resourcesas far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you i suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support this may help with two things allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell himone thing that i tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation that way you have greater chances of having the persons attention andor not needing to end the conversation quickly also please remember that you know yourself best as each of us does
798,im a girl and i cant tell whether im bisexual or gay i like girls a little more than boys but i dont really know,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,sexual orientation is not always something that is clearly definable some people look at it on a continuum where being attracted to only boys is at one end only girls is at the other and bisexual is in the middle anywhere in between those points can be any amount of attraction to boys or girlsif you dont know whether you are gay or bisexual that is okay a lot of people dont know for quite some time in addition to that after people do know who they are attracted to a lot of times they do not use the terms gay or bisexual for quite a whileits okay not to knowthink about what sorts of expectations you have for your ideal relationship some examples may include trust respect availability for conversation or connection etc whatever it is that you find important in a relationship is likely what matters mostif you are struggling with learning what it is that you would like in a relationship or any other feelings connected with what you are thinking and feeling i would suggest connecting with a local therapist so you have a place to talk about what you are experiencing
799,i went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide when i went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that i put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders he was very angry that i went to him to do that am i in the wrong for going to him to reach out he helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why i thought of him to reach out he made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help why did he react this way towards me i think hes being selfish,social relationshipsintimacy,anxiety disorders,im glad you think so highly of your boyfriend and his ability to be there when you would like to talk about things that are important to youi see why you would want them to reach out i also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out it sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friends wellbeing although i cant say that for certainwould you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes five minutes or so you ask him about what made him react that way during this time try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience you can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does this does not mean that you have to agree with what you say but just that you follow i hear you saying that you think hes being selfish im suggesting that just during this conversation you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling in one sentence the goal would be to learn more about his experiencei would not be at all surprised if he is scaredare you aware of what kind of support he wants through this time
800,ive been on  mg of xanax twice a day for the past month it hasnt been helping me at all but when i take  mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to  mg twice a day without her thinking im abusing them i just have very big anxiety attacks should i stay on the mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,anxiety,anxiety disorders,staying on the lower dose may give you more room to learn strategies for coping with your anxiety  medications are so helpful and needed at times but its also important to have a variety of tools you use to manage your responses to stress  if you are not already seeing a therapist consider finding one who can help you learn some effective strategies like replacing selfdefeating thoughts with ones that work better for you or mindfulness relaxation or other tools to keep your anxiety in the manageable range
801,he is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault he bashes me to our young child and he is addicted to a few substances,marriageintimacyaddictionbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,the behaviors you describe are boundary violations  you can not change your spouse but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety  this is very hard to do without support  finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful  if you are not ready to do this i recommend the book boundaries by dr henry cloud and dr john townsend  its a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive

803,i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,depressionanxiety,anxiety disorders,is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked   if this is possible interview a therapist before  starting therapy   then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your lifealso therapy isnt for everyoneread about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling betterwhat matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods what you believe will be effective

805,these jokes are made about everything they seem to have the need to say something funny about everything its not funny just awkward,social relationships,anxiety disorders,i agree it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all  and if a person only jokes then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer this can also be quite tediousrealize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression  you could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave
806,im in my early s ive worked since two months after i turned  i have plans i could become an electrician or i could operate heavy machinery i have goals but i do nothing to try to meet them because i dont feel i can i just want a better life for my fiancée and the kids than i did,depressionselfesteem,mood disorders,for starters commend yourself for being committed to working you have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story  remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up  the false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams next do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator if not find out then set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps as you accomplish each step see your progress  notice that you are moving closer to your goal  every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career  in fact write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror  when you start to feel discouraged remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if youll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work stay with it you and your family are worth it
807,my husband had an emotional affair with his exwife in november she invited him to dinner alone with their daughter i wasnt aware of this until after pm when i asked where he was he had been drinking and i told him not to come home that night the next morning we talked about going to counseling he went out that night with friends and said his exwife wasnt going i found out in april that she did go i gave him the chance to get everything out in the open i found out that he stayed that second night with her i asked if they slept in the same bed and he said yes both nights his daughter wasnt there the second night he claims they didnt have sex but what else should i think,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,my answer is going to be super simplistic but i believe this may be what you need ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you  if he says yes then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional  if he says no then you can file for divorce
808,i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs his coworker sent him an inappropriate video he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that,relationshipsworkplace relationships,anxiety disorders,in my book this is a boundary issue although you do not like inappropriate content it is not up to you what your childs father looks at or what his friend sends him  it is really hard not to monitor other peoples lives but in the end your rights begin and end with you
809,im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do,relationshipsintimacylgbtq,mood disorders,divorce is expensive emotionally and financially if your fiance is not ok with an open marriage it would be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor before you get married
810,i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,parenting,anxiety disorders,its normal for a child to be so angry she wanted someone to die but this seems to be heading into a dangerous realm i think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious
811,sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost  minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,anxiety,anxiety disorders,though i dont know for sure it sounds like anxiety to me i think it would be helpful if you work with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders
812,i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,depressionanxiety,anxiety disorders,im sorry that you have tried several different things and not had much reliefi will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different so it is quite possible that a different combination of things youve already tried may be helpfuli would encourage you to continue trying different therapists i would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you also most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done but after that the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping if something is or is not working communicate this with your therapist this is a big deal most therapists i know actually welcome this feedbackthere is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important also sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis if that is something with which you are struggling i would encourage you to talk about that as wellin addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with you may consider trying something like yoga or meditation mindfulness is sometimes helpful as wellheres a link to questions for finding suitable therapists httpwwwpharmatherapistcomtipsforfindingasuitabletherapist

815,ive been with a man for four years for the last year he has said he is done but he still talks texts visits and has not moved on with anyone else his words do not match his actions i love this man but its hurting so much,relationships,anxiety disorders,this can be difficult and confusingif you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion when that time matches with a time that is good for you try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there he may want to be really good friends he may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling if you end up talking over one another try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience then you can switch also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but lead to more explanationsquestions that start with the words how what when who are usually better than questions starting with why because they can be emotional triggers for some peopleif this is difficult to do between the two of you consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples
816,my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one i neglected to ask how this was different than an episode i have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type ,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,i will admit that im not specifically familiar with this from my own experiencemy best educated guess is that you could have a seizure during which you have some sort of symptoms similar to a hallucination which is one of the psychotic symptoms when you hear or see things that arent really therein looking briefly online i was able to find some information here httpwwwepilepsycominformationprofessionalsaboutepilepsyseizurespsychiatricandbehavioralaspectspsychiatricit sounds like this would be a symptom in addition to an already existing seizure disorder not a seizure disorder in addition to a mental health problem if it is the other way around im not sure how that would work it is common with some types of seizures to have an altered state of reality during or shortly after the seizure so that could also be relatedi would suggest you talk to your physician about this directly so that if they are worried about this you can learn more about what is making them concerned about it and what if anything you could do to lessen the likelihood of it or how to handle it if it does happen
817,ive been with a man for four years for the last year he has said he is done but he still talks texts visits and has not moved on with anyone else his words do not match his actions i love this man but its hurting so much,relationships,anxiety disorders,have you brought up the topic as to the way youre feelingthe best way for someone to understand us or to understand someone is to directly talk about  the specific problemto start the discussion w your partner understand your own reasons for continuing the relationshipgiven his stated disinterest in the relationship your mood is probably affected by thisonce you are clear on how the range of your feelings especially any fears on being alone suggesting you may be staying w this guy simply to avoid such fears then youll be ready w your selfknowledge to start a conversation w your partner about your relationship
818,we had great chemistry but then he became distant i had the feeling that i cant be without him as soon as i felt the difference i was scared to lose him i started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened,relationshipsbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,the simplest answer is that love feels good obsessions dontlove deepens a sense of peacefulness and securityobsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandonedone suggestion is to study more about yourself and why youd feel so ill at ease when you arent w this person
819,we had great chemistry but then he became distant i had the feeling that i cant be without him as soon as i felt the difference i was scared to lose him i started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened,relationshipsbehavioral change,anxiety disorders,people often care deeply for those whom they love i dont know how long you have been together it is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to youit may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away it may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you for example maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he cansometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you you could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy you have the ability to write a message and he has the ability to answer when he cani also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened i dont know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your lifesome people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry but this is difficult for othersi would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved valued appreciated or specialalso think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argumentit may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first such as taking a  minute timeout if it becomes overwhelmingperhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person remember that feeling heard does not mean that you have to agree with one another
820,i shake and have panic attacks,stressanxiety,anxiety disorders,one of the first things i would suggest is to see if you can keep track of what is leading you to feel anxious if you shake all the time consider talking with your primary care physician sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroidone of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety particularly panic attacks can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks also remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brains protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat you may have heard of the fight or flight response when you have an anxiety attack your body is preparing you to react to something that isnt actually a threat so its almost as if youre fight or flight response is overactive here is an image that may be helpful httppsychologytoolsfightorflightresponsehtmlthere are many different things you can do you can practice breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga techniques if you decide to try some breathing techniques try breathing in for a count of five holding for a count of five breathing out for a count of five and repeating five timesalso remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when youre not having a panic attack at that point it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic also remember that panic attacks typically last  to  minutes using techniques to slow your breathing or become focused on the room around you is probably most helpful when you first start to feel anxioushere are some other techniques that may help to decrease anxiety httppsychcentralcomlibwaystoreduceanxietyrighthererightnowas you figure out what is leading up to your anxiety also consider asking yourself what is making that certain issue a big concern for you another important question could be when you have felt that way before

824,im a teenager my dad has been jail for the last five years its tough but my mom really tries to give a normal life to my two sisters my brother and i i feel like i took upon a parent role when im the second youngest and im not stable my mother and sisters say im overdramatic im just so hurt and i keep breaking down,family conflictdepression,mood disorders,it sounds like you have a lot of weight on your shouldersim not sure what you mean when you say youre not stable and you are breaking down if you are crying because youre sad that is okay if you are crying a lot or having trouble eating or sleeping thats different than just crying sometimes because you are sad it may be helpful to talk with a local mental health professional in your area they can help you to figure out what you could do differently to have the role in your family that you would like while also supporting yourself and what you want

826,she constantly tells me what i am doing wrong for once i want her to be proud of me its like no matter what i do she does not have one nice word to say to me she is always hateful towards me and always has been,family conflict,mood disorders,i imagine this is very difficult and confusing for youit sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself which is really good i hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that youre doingif you think your mom would be willing to go to see a local mental health professional with you that may be a good place to have some discussions about the relationship that the two of you have the reason im suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselvesif you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you if youre going to have a conversation like that i would suggest you try these thingsask her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation if she says no consider asking her when would be a better timetry to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this if you can ask questions to learn more about that you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feelingthis doesnt mean that you have to agree with her but just that you are able to hear where she is coming fromtry to ask questions that start with the words who what how where when questions that start with the word why can be difficult to answer and can lead to a lot of extra emotiontry to summarize what she is saying to see if you have it rightif you want your mom to know how you feel after you can listen to what she is saying and see if she is willing to listen to what you would like to sayif youre going to tell your mom about how you feel consider having some points written down ahead of time so you can explain yourself the way that you want toit will probably be really hard to listen to her without being defensive right away i know i would be wanting to jump right into the conversation remember that jumping in right away will probably make it more difficult to learn where your mom is coming fromalso if she says she doesnt want to have a conversation remember that she has that choiceif your mom does not want to go to see a counselor with you remember that you could go on your own depending on your state and exactly how old you are you may need your parents permission to be in treatment but not always if you need help to figure that out try contacting a couple of local mental health agencies to see if they can help you figure out what to do if you want to talk to someone

838,in middle school and high school my friends and family thought i was gay i tried telling them but they wouldnt believe me it almost feels like they wanted me to be now im actually starting to believe them i know i wasnt back then and now im not sure anymore,lgbtq,anxiety disorders,i agree with amy we get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we want at a pretty early age the truth is our sexuality can change and grow in directions we never imagined i may be wrong but i am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay that this is something you didnt like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true this would certainly be understandable your sexuality is yours and yours alone it can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are and it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself the truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation it may help to think about what qualities you find attractive what kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to someone smart funny loves dogs if you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not at least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire another idea is to chat with a counselor if you are interested preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy be well and be yourobin  j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
839,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,traumarelationships,mood disorders,one thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice that may help to center you tried to stay grounded andor mindful that is being aware of your position in the room your feet on the floor your hands in your lap or your hips in the chair being mindful of the environment you are currently for example noticing what is around you may be helpful try to use all your senses for example you could focus on hearing your husbands voice feeling his hand in yours being wrapped in your favorite blanket seeing a comforting photo using a comforting sense or candle or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchenit also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma i would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professionalremember just because it was the best decision of your life that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again this is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all

842,ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,i imagine that its pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourselfwhen you said that you are jaded im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone something life in general or some combination thereofone of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they dont go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some wayas far as finding yourself you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered you could also focus on something that makes you feel happy andor comfortableyou may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you what it is that you are living by now and what values you would prefer to live by httpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarificationif this proves to be difficult consider seeing a local therapist

847,my fiancé and i recently had an argument over finances he gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance he no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy he realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why i was allowing him to continue to do that since i was physically paying it for him my response was that he was giving me the money and i just made the payment i didnt think of the coverages he was angry about it i still cant figure out that anger,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,a few things come to mind i wonder if your fiancé is still angry about it or if he was angry in that moment and has now worked through itit sounds like there was also a difference in expectations here you were just  paying the bill with the money he was giving to you and he may have assumed you were reading it you thought that you were following his directions it could be that you could have a discussion about it but that depends on how much of a hot button issue it still is for either of youif youre going to talk about it i might suggest asking whether this would be a good time to have a discussion about what happened with the automobile insurance so that you can both use the opportunity to learn more about yourselves and each other around this particular issue
848,she said she needed space after three days of dating and she got a boyfriend a week later i still really miss her and she told me she still likes me,relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,it sounds as if your exgirlfriend is trying to figure out what type of relationship she is looking to have with you there are lots of levels of relationships from a basic acquaintance to a more friendly acquaintance to a friend close friend best friend early romantic partner committed romantic partner and many moreif she is willing to have a conversation with you about her feelings it may be helpful to have her explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but are what are called openended questions which ask her to provide more information during this process it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective after you have done this for five minutes its a rough estimate but basically until you can restate what she is saying and she says you have it right you can switch so she is asking you questions about how you are feeling the goal is not necessarily to change the outcome but to learn more about yourselves and each otherthen you may have an idea of where you stand in each others eyes
849,i recently went through a divorce my exhusband called my sister saying bad things about me my sister never defended me now that i showed the truth shes shutting me up and saying she doesnt care about the fight why didnt she convey that to him from the beginning,family conflictrelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,unfortunately i cant tell you what your sister was feeling or why she reacted that wayi can say that divorces can be difficult or confusing for everyone involved while the divorce is most impactful for the couple going through it the divorce itself also changes extended family dynamics also a lot of people dont act the same way around extended family or other people as they do at home behind closed doors so there are times when divorce is a real shock to everyone who was not directly involved in iti wonder if you are at a place where you can shift your focus into looking at your relationship with your sister how she is treating you how you feel around her now etc i do not know how close you were before all of this and how close you feel now but perhaps if you can assess your overall relationship you could find a time when you could ask about this why she didnt convey that to him from the beginning in a way that is calm not defensive and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister not looking to defend yourself at that moment if that conversation can happen it may be quite a difficult one so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation its not about you but is about where she was coming from after you think you understand that im saying that you understand where shes coming from not that you agree with what shes saying you could see if shes willing to listen to how you feel about it
850,ive known him for about six years weve dated off and on i hadnt seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again i really want this to last this time i stayed the night do i text call or make contact first the same day of the morning i left his house,relationshipsintimacyanxiety,anxiety disorders,i dont see why you cant call text or make contact first it would be up to him to reply when he can and wants to but i dont know why you couldnt initiate contactone thing to consider as you get to know each other better is having conversations about conversations for example you could say id like to call or text you more often but im concerned about _____ listing what you are most worried about then he can discuss his reaction and you can have a dialogue about it
851,im a teenager and while ive never been to any kind of therapist i noticed i experience several anxiety symptoms i frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house i cant go into stores grocery stores specifically on my own and when i do i have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time i also forget things a lot,anxiety,anxiety disorders,with the way you described your anxiety it sounds like you have different types of anxiety im not sure whether you have anxiety of public places large crowds being alone  sometimes called separation anxiety or some combination thereofone thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are on a scale of  to  in different situations also if you know what leads up to your anxiety it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patternsas for forgetting things you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious when you are having anxiety certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode its also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not relatedsomething else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfortanother thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety one thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems just for the regular physical so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutesalso if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings during this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well for example in the grocery store if you are feeling anxious you could say to yourself im anxious right now and im okay while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other no one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to youanxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it if it is difficult for you to work it out on your own which is very common consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideasalso consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable
852,my fiancé and i broke up he cheated on me numerous times i kept forgiving but questioning his every move he got tired and left,relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,there is a grieving process after losing a relationship or any other major loss such as a job a house etc one of the things to consider is give yourself a chance to go through the tasks of mourningto accept the reality of the lossto process the pain of griefto adjust to a world without the person who has just leftto find an enduring connection with that person in the midst of embarking on a new life this could mean a lot of things but it could be holding certain memories as your ownyou may also find things that make you feel happy or comfortable its also helpful to have people who you can talk to about your feelings and people who may be able to recognize things about you that you cannot see right now such as how you are honest committed to your work a good listener etcthis takes some time try to be gentle with yourself
853,my spouse decided he no longer wanted me six years ago things have deteriorated so badly that we have separated but still live in the same house he says he despises the sight of me wants to be with other women and divorce what i dont understand is that he says constantly that i have no feelings for him and gets absurdly jealous if i speak to another male why does he constantly do these behaviors i might add he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and as a narcissist,relationshipsrelationship dissolution intimacy,mood disorders,it sounds like this is quite difficultit sounds as if sometimes your spouse want you to be a part of his life which could be a part of where the jealousy comes from and sometimes he doesnt talking about this would likely be a delicate conversation and from what you mention he has been diagnosed with im wondering if he has a therapist if so do you know whether he would allow you to come to one session so you can learn more about how he feels maybe he would be to use more of it because in the contained environment of an therapy office this way at least you would know where hes coming from you could also ask whether he is able to hear what you want wish for or desire between the two of youremember just because you hear or follow what he is saying does not imply that you agree with him although that concept in itself could be a subject of discussion because not everyone is aware of iti hope that you are able to hold onto who you are and what you want throughout this

855,ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and i dont know how to process this its bothering both of us,selfesteemrelationships,mood disorders,this can be really anxietyproducing when you have not felt it before it may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideassome other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about  minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like this allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you this gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to youi would also wonder where you have learned that there wasnt much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that you could even remind yourself okay im here with name of girlfriend and this is okay when im with herwe all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people its common for people to see these things as black and white either totally open or very selfprotective in reality its much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light its not really just red orange yellow green blue indigo violet that we all know but an infinite spectrum of shades of colors that fade from one into the next you can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in the mood you are both in the subject etc there are infinite numbers of choices and you can experimentanother thing that could help is to communicate about communication if one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable you could discuss that if she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable you could discuss that as wellhopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time
856,shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family we dont talk much because of it also we have little fights we want to work it out but we dont know how,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,maybe you can start with having  minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other even if it needs to be on the phone because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time at least you would know there was that time that was set aside that may also help you to rekindle some conversations between youas far as your little fights consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are openended cannot be answered with just yes or no and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing then once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch its also good to restate what you think you are hearing then you know what each other is truly following about this also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming fromalso consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated think of the same for your girlfriend this could be a great discussion to have as well

858,"i want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it
i seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship i let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling i let men emotionally abuse me and i am at their beck and call
i am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself i feel i need the security of someone being around just to survive i know what im doing wrong and i do it anyway just hoping things will change how do i stop this behavior and thought process",relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,here are some things im wonderingdo you have close friends that you can talk to trust and who can be around sometimes when youre in between relationshipswhat do you like about yourself what are your strongest pointsdo you think you have been in relationships with controlling than in the past because it makes you feel as though you are worth something to themwhat kind of relationship you want to be inwhat are the top three or four attributes of the type of partner you wantwhat can you do to make yourself emotionally safe during your typical daily activitiescan you notice a list of things that you can control throughout a typical day for example you probably choose what to wear what to eat how to talk to others how committed you are to school or work etcit also sounds as if it may be helpful to discover more about yourself in addition to what you look for in a partneras far as emotional abuse it may be useful to develop communication skills that you could use prior to their relationship progressing to the point that it is emotional abusethank you for reaching out to ask questions if the questions that ive asked here are difficult for you to answer or are overwhelming talking with a local therapist would probably be something i would suggest

861,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,anxiety disorders,the older i get the more i believe that our real task isnt to find ourselves were already  there what we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive most happy most creative and most fully engaged with life it is in those moments that we find ourselvesfor example i couldnt help loving the people or things i loved no matter who tried to talk me out of them all i needed to do was notice when my heart opened and i felt the most alivenot because i was afraid or addicted but because in those moments i was in contact with my highest self on the flip side i needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in methe ones that made me feel controlled constricted dishonest resentful or afraidand be honest about them mindfulness of what already is is the key to finding yourself align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you dont let old habits crappy jobs or meanspirited people define you just stumble your way forward as best you can with greater selfawareness followed by affirmative action

881,a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,anxietysocial relationships,anxiety disorders,hello and thank you for your question first i want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue everyone at some point in time has a fear of public embarrassment but for many people this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life  they will try to avoid any situation that they even think will cause them embarrassment or anxiety escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness isolation and even despair by avoiding we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment there are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue you can do an internet search and i recommend reading the reviews of the book that is  great way to find out if others have found the book helpful another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear i would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety acceptance and commitment therapy is  a good choice for helping with anxiety but there are many others the truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever get over but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently a colleague may offer some other advice as well be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc

890,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,relationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,this has to be very difficult to endureits pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like i cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hoursmy best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is it could even be that hes learned to handle conflict that waysomething else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not these sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couplesas far as what you can do now perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before that you love him and believe that he loves you or some other statements that are true for you you may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself for example you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure
891,sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious  i even start throwing things do i have a problem,anger management,anxiety disorders,i dont like the word problem  it is such a strong word  however i would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control  i have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients  try and see if it will help  you will be surprised at what you learn about your self

898,how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have  what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has ive read about this online but id like to understand this from a therapists point of view,diagnosiscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,thats a great question there is such a wide range of ways to define personality that it is difficult to identify specific characteristics that are used to identify personality typesthat being said some clinicians will use standardized tests or assessments to assess a clients type of personality while these tests cant tell us everything about a person they can help us understand where we are within larger groups of different personality stylessome counselors will also use a diagnostic tool like the dsm or icd to help a client understand a diagnosis that is related to a personality disorder

how do i get away from this relationship",relationships,anxiety disorders,im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuseone of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving safe and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgement rights opinions overall way of thinkingthis happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful  regardless of how irrational wrong mean selfish intimidating thoughtless a partner is to the other the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactionsstick with what your own intuition tells youthere is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going onleaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree  people are in familiar patterns of daily behavior no one wants to suddenly be alone even if this only means showing up as a physical body not as a truly loving partner no one wants to start telling others about a breakup answer questions about it feel blamed worry what others thinkthese are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heartlisten to yourself about leaving this guy your inner self does not lie to you

912,i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,people do cry in therapy sometimes but its not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful when you start counseling you dont yet know your counselor very well so its normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor you might just cry in spite of your fears about it your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality so even though its embarrassing finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it its okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that youre kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person

now if someone brings it up i get really upset and panicked i dont know why i feel like this does this mean there is something wrong with me",behavioral changesocial relationships,anxiety disorders,the good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you   im glad you have awareness and im glad you are not at ease with killing frogsfairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violencebasically you did unto the frog what someone has or to you feels like has been done to youuse your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain   reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you   it is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realizedstabbing innocent frogs is wrong  it is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably haveit is also wrong that someone close to you hurt youthe direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships
923,im depressed often and my mind goes a million miles a minute every once in a while things are okay for a few days after a bit i start noticing that i am picking at my skin profusely after roughly a week the anxiety is back and still picking sometimes i find myself causing fights to have change,anxietydepression,anxiety disorders,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that you are struggling i have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions as you have experienced this means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling some people may take medication for the rest of their lives some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens as you mentioned sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while but they can also come back when they do it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication andor to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down it is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so these are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression that is a very normal thing to do nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them the problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a longterm solution in fact they usually make things worse for many different reasons depression and anxiety can  be treated but it is likely something you will need some help with i would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression medication can be helpful but i still recommend counseling the reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
924,my boyfriend wont touch me intimately he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me i know he has done this things with other women in the past i dont know why he wont do them with me what should i do,human sexualityintimacy,mood disorders,first off dont blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions  human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times eg what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time there could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxietymaybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner thats left him scared to try again we call this operant conditioning  it could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers  sometimes i refer to this as the hookerhousewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal  drives many partners crazy until theyre aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them it could also be that hes not even aware that hes not doing these things if you havent asked him yet you might try gently approaching the subject when youre not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you or has enjoyed in the past or thinks he might enjoy  you can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him  give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if hed be down to go downtown  baby it really turns me on when you kiss me during sexif you continue to get the impression that its somehow only about you or that hes just really hesitant to talk about sex in general you might see if hed be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy

can you explain whats going on",behavioral changesocial relationships,anxiety disorders,teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind  so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development you are not at all aloneyouve taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware the more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts the more you can learn to manage them your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try  for example identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response such as taking a deep breath informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as i am responsible for my efforts and blame is not helpful for anyone and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight when you practice thinking more rational healthy thoughts you are actually rewiring your brain so practice is key

1000,im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her how can i learn how to listen and get myself together,relationships,anxiety disorders,the first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that so you are already on the right trackas far as learning how to listen try some of these stepsask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationif she has a subject that she would like to discuss consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience these questions usually begin with words like who what where when questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way you can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicatethen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience you could also start by talking about something that is important to youremember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesnt mean that you agreealso try sticking to one subject at a time its difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twotry to use the word want or wish instead of need saying that you need something or if your girlfriend would say that that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation that takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changesomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout consider thisdiscuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five   minutes or maybe even an hour when there are a lot of emotions happening each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceivingwhen using timeout say to your girlfriend or she can say to you i need an hour before we can go back to this then actually come back to the discussionsome people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way this is why the agreement is important before you need itwhile it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practicetry to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants wishes and desires while recognizing those of your partneras one final idea consider spending about  minutes a week together where you are not problemsolving about anything just connecting with one anotheri encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between youbest wishes
1001,im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her how can i learn how to listen and get myself together,relationships,anxiety disorders,the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue it consists of  steps mirroring what she says without judging commenting refuting defending arguing or scoffingjust listening no matter the content and repeating it back wordforword continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesnt validating you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way if you dont understand then find a way you can also say that makes sense or i hear you or i get that empathizing tell her how you think she must feel about what shes telling you your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be herthis is a very different way of communicating than were used to my guess is that the arguments discussions and debates youve had with her have been counterproductive because youre both trying to win with imago dialogue you both win she gets to be heard and you get to hear for a changeat the end of the exercise switch roles for more info httpimagorelationshipsorgpubaboutimagotherapyimagodialogue
1002,i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,anxietystress,anxiety disorders,have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class   the more confident you feel in a safe space the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger groupgiving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication   it has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearlypractice practice and practice until you see yourself improve in how you presentalso keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxiousanxiety heightens fear so whatever concerns you have check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivitygood luck

1004,"my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away  every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive 

 i love him so much  why do i do this",intimacyrelationships,mood disorders,are you sure it is only the birth control pills which has changed your sex drivemy guess would be that possibly due to the hormonal changes of the pill your own awareness and understanding of yourself in this relationship is what is actually changingbirth control pills control ovulation   they dont directly prevent people from all desire to express affectionallow yourself some time to reflect on how you feel toward your bf   it is possible the birth control pills triggered a change in your attitude toward himand maybe independent of the pill maybe you just are done with the relationship
1005,i just feel sad all the time and i dont like anyone in my family i feel like theyre trying to control me and wont let me grow,family conflictdepression,mood disorders,hellowhile one can be sad from time to time feeling sad all the time could be a sign of depression if you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life however feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life if it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family is it that you do not feel heard supported or loved is it that you feel disrespected disregarded or feel unimportant these are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression to help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process you do not have to deal with it alone dr virginia chow montreal psychologist for more information about depression please consult my website at wwwpsychologyresourceca

1007,my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that im doing things she finds disrespectful even when i dont mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart  i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  she doesnt and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand,relationshipsmarriageworkplace relationships,mood disorders,hello that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story i would say that you are raising  different concerns one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified it may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said  if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsthe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of im sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says im sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other

 i love him so much  why do i do this",intimacyrelationships,mood disorders,there could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away it could be part of how you were raised it could be because of culture it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you pushing him away what is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect so what if you arent a hugger a kisser or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship there are many ways to show affection that arent physical words of affirmation giving of time andor gifts etc if your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching
1009,my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that im doing things she finds disrespectful even when i dont mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart  i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her  she doesnt and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand,relationshipsmarriageworkplace relationships,mood disorders,here is the truth you will never get her to understand because that would mean changing her and we cant change other people we can only change ourselves i would recommend to take the time to self reflect on what exactly it is that you are doing that is contributing to the mixup you both have very valid feelings and those wont magically go away until you address the root problem which could be many factors i am curious to know more about past relationships the both of you have had and how that plays a role in your current relationship many times we dont realize how past relationships truly impact our current behaviors
1010,my husband and i have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times others have told me that most men would have left me by now honestly i think i have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing i want to be better connected with my husband,human sexualityintimacymarriage,mood disorders,i work with many couples that experience a wide range of sexual and relationship challenges the one aspect i tell many folks that i work with is this every person and relationship is different there really isnt a normal amount of sex a person should have or want to have if having sex  to  times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband there is nothing wrong with it if you or your husband would like to have sex more often i suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied the aspect of connectedness is an important one while sex can be very connecting for many couples it isnt the only way to connect i find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex checking in to see how you and your husband feel as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to fulfilling this need

he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way",human sexualityintimacyrelationships,mood disorders,hello and thank you for your question nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new many people who engage in open polyamorous andor othertype relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes this doesnt prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one and many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception there could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do one reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages they are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesnt mean that you havent been influenced by them we all have another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening perhaps there are a lot of what ifs going on in your mind when you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling one thing that i do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband it may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if you will it is important that you are both on the same page about what this is and why you are doing it if you continue to struggle i suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality  i wish you wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
1012,i dont know how to tell someone how i feel about them how can i get better at expressing how i feel,relationships,anxiety disorders,"lets just start with being real expressing
yourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard it takes courage and work
to be vulnerable my guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable ie expressing yourself is unsafe my assumption would be
you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again this is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt it
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayi would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally after you feel you have a good grasp
on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others choose others that
feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family
member expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors
just the same best of luck"

1014,we werent long distance until he joined the military  i love him and i know he loves me but its complicated he said hes not going to find someone else but im afraid how do i keep our relationship going,relationshipsmilitary issues ,anxiety disorders,hello you are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship i wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him  or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future the more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure however if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship to help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment for many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and skype its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life other times it is making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for longdistance ones dr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca
1015,we werent long distance until he joined the military  i love him and i know he loves me but its complicated he said hes not going to find someone else but im afraid how do i keep our relationship going,relationshipsmilitary issues ,anxiety disorders,youre right that longdistance relationships can be complicated if he loves you and you love him thats a great start i wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved valued special and appreciatedwhen having important discussions consider the followingmake sure it is a good time to have a discussion and if youre doing it in writing because of the distance you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesnt have  minutes or something like thattry to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversationswhen having discussions facetoface i often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in  minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them as for how that translates to distance maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the internet or if possible use some kind of timeframeconsider what questions you would like answers to for example are you wonderingwhat should i do if i miss you or want to talk to you more i dont want to make you feel guilty but i also dont want to hide my feelings can i share them with youif you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly can i keep sending you messages or is that overwhelminghow will you ask for support from mesome couples really want to protect each other in doing so instead of hiding our emotions can we share them and work through them togetherwhatever else comes to mindgary chapman is famous for his books about the  love languages he has one specifically for military families the  love languages military edition the secret to love that lastsheres a list of books related to loving from a distance httpwwwlongdistancerelationshipsnetbookstorhtmi have not read these books myself but i have read other works by a lot of the authorsone final tip consider making a list of times when you work together and both feeling calm safe and comfortable these memories could be helpful to you during difficult momentsbest wishes to you remember that you could each see therapists in your respective locations if that would be helpful to you

1020,weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker i dont know how to approach this situation how do i ask him about it,relationships,anxiety disorders,i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others these questions help couples to build connection and trust its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance if he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that if he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actionsdr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca

1024,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxietybehavioral change,anxiety disorders,hello and thank you for your question overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we arent afraid anymore but sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them there are some options you can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment what kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing for example if you have a general phobia about something they may use various techniques to help you manage it   there are different websites and even some selfhelp books that you can use to try to overcome your fears when it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias exposure therapy wellstudied and proven to work a therapist would help you with this but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself i am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools httppsychologytoolsanxietyhtmlsome colleagues may offer you some other types of advice be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc

1026,i know im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make  i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life but i just cant seem to even though i really want to why cant i force myself to change,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,hello and thank you for your question changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important here are a few things i would suggest get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that can be changed sometimes we will set a goal like i want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change  if you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it so if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual  if you are going to make changes really nail down why you want to make them what is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person for example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare knowing why you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there  once you know why you want to make these changes i strongly suggest setting small goals if you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse so make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person  as sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpcc

1029,sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost  minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,anxiety,anxiety disorders,feelings of anxiety can be scary and sometimes were not aware of the triggers that lead up to moments of anxiety i e heart racing sweaty palms sweating shortness of breath its important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body  mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals like adrenaline or cortisol  so one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety such as fear stress negative thought patterns not enough food or sleep keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills  techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep one quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes sometimes this is called belly breathing when you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress  anxiety

1035,i am a heterosexual male in my late s i find myself wearing pantyhose heels skirts and other womens clothing in private i am torn on how to feel about it i enjoy it very much i have had a pantyhosestocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since i was young i have no history of sexual abuse growing up i am currently single,human sexualitylgbtq,anxiety disorders,"hi there it sounds like you have already started to answer
your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much and i am
glad you enjoy it cross dressing is something many people enjoy and there is
no harm in it whatsoever my question to you would be what is making you feel torn
about it there is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with
people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the
majority and sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or
even in the majority but because people carry shame about being different when
it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alonebeing a sexual or gender minority or someone who
participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a
unique and personal way often means suffering from something called
internalized oppression we grow up being exposed to certain
assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even
face consequences sometimes if we dont fit in the way others tell
us to even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong we still internalize
them and feel guilty about who we are there is nothing wrong with us but
feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame embarrassment
or like something is wrong with usbut there is absolutely nothing wrong with you so be proud
of who you are and what you enjoy you can continue to simply enjoy it
privately or maybe youd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe
even join a community with similar interests ill leave you with a quote from
comedian eddie izzard who identifies as in his own words a straight
transvestite theyre not womens clothes theyre my clothes i
bought them take care and thanks for your question"

1038,weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a  female coworker i dont know how to approach this situation how do i ask him about it,relationships,anxiety disorders,just ask himim not sure how you saw his phone if youre in a long distance relationship because long distance means you live far apart from each other and dont get to see each other in person therefore i think we may have a different understanding of the definition of long distance relationship which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for youi dont know how old you are but if youre an adult after two and a half years i dont think its unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you dont ever see each other in person talking texting and video chatting isnt enough and the longer the physical distance remains the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness it may be time to evaluate the situation figure out when if ever the two of you will be able to be together in person and if you can and want to wait that long do you both want the same things out of life if one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesnt then it doesnt matter if its long distance or not  if you arent on the same page with the relationship it is going to be difficult to make it worktrust is important issues with trust insecurity jealousy lying andor hiding things from each other being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation  these things can ruin relationships if not addressed i know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people but it is necessary at times evaluate your true feelings for him are you with him for reasons other than love such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldnt be able to find someone else has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before some people unfortunately develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them however if this is not the case you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecurities it may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship figure out what you want and make a decision this may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level or it could lead to a decision to end things i know that can be difficult but you both deserve to be happy and to be allowed to make the decisions that will lead to your personal happiness

1040,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxietybehavioral change,anxiety disorders,biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation a phobia however is different you used the term fear rather than phobia a phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing if your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome iteveryone has fears or things that make them nervous public speaking asking a person out fear of failure examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear when you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue a lot of times it is a selfesteem issue you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out whats causing it and deal with the real issue some fears are caused by trauma someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldnt notice or react to in cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear i strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims
1041,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,mood disorders,the answer would require a more indepth knowledge of you and your situation a lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way you internalize it and accept it as your reality the first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents even if you are an adult think back to your childhood children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems the obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a personyou may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally were you yelled at berated put down were you told youd never amount to anything were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldnt live up to expectations when you hear something over and over again you start to believe itmaybe you werent yelled at maybe it was the opposite studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect a chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless she may have been less likely to show interest in a childs life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being metany of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they dont mattermaybe nothing ive described here fits your situation if you cant pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can helpi am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you theres nothing you can do to change it quite the opposite understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition  figure out the why then behavior  the how
1042,my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless  he calls me names and makes me feel depressed  i want to move out because i swear if i stay here im going to lose it what can i do,family conflictparenting,anxiety disorders,are you old enough to move out then by all means whats stopping youif not is it possible for you to move in with another family memberif youre a minor cps may need to step in they often do in cases of abuse your safety is the number one priorityits difficult to offer advice without knowing more about your situation but i can say this dont let other people define your self worth you can choose not to allow him to make you feel anything it really is that simple by looking at it as a choice you make you will be empowered to take control over your emotions and learn to feel better about yourself because your selfworth will no longer be defined by what someone else says about you or how they treat youlet me say that again in a different way your selfworth is not defined by someone else the way he treats you is a reflection of who he is as a person  not you dont take ownership of that i understand that if you are a minor setting healthy boundaries and refusing to accept this kind of treatment can be difficult reach out to others for help but if you are  and over there is absolutely no excuse for you to be there having to put up with maltreatment put up some boundaries and create the distance needed to protect yourself emotionally you owe it to yourself and deserve to live a healthy happy life anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong
1043,"my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away  every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive 

 i love him so much  why do i do this",intimacyrelationships,mood disorders,i sympathize with you it is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other and can lead to discord in the relationship the good news is there are ways to deal with thisyou may have already answered your question there are many medications that can alter ones sex drive if your birth control pills are the cause of this talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand you may even consider alternate methods for birth control such as condomshowever there are some other things to ask yourself first you used the term affection but then talked about sex theyre not the same thing there are different kinds of intimacy and many different ways to show love for someone a book you might find useful is the five love languagesdefining what affection means to you and to him and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other may help lessen some of your anxiety over thishumans are hardwired to need appropriate physical touch in fact studies have shown that newbornspremies who can receive skinonskin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who dont receive this touch its called kangaroo care children who have grown up in neglectful environments where theyre not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when theyre adults one question to ask yourself is were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication if so there may be other deeper issues at play herefor someone who has received the wrong kind of sexualphysical touch sexual abuse physical beatings it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you a therapist could help you work through thissometimes a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship once those issues are resolved the sex drive comes back examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy if youve been arguing a lot or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressedfinally look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a nonsexual way you may be doing things for each other that you dont even realize and noticing these will help you appreciate it more take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways some people like to give gifts do the other persons chores or do other things they think the person will appreciateif after all of this you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful it is a very common issue for a lot of couples
1044,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxietybehavioral change,anxiety disorders,fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said im scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c

1050,"my fiancé and i have been together for  years and our relationship has always been good the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me 

i recently found out he cheated on me with another women  he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do  is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on",intimacyrelationshipshuman sexuality,mood disorders,i think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question  i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again  once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions  first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work  but theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed  you say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core  would you agree with that or what are your thoughts  were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives  if you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs  for instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested  this is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations  in essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal  until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually  this leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling  you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called the five love languages  its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallythis is a long post im sorry  but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it  so back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this  for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again  of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt  you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back  you cant just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it  but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him  get that bookin conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache  there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place  rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past  i truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there  if you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again

1055,i just dont know what i want in life anymore im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused i cant put things into perspective at all im just stuck and im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments,selfesteemdepression,mood disorders,if you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself  if this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot  maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own  you might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you dont create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you  if you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family its easy to recreate this in adult relationshipsin both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self  basically you spend so much time helping other people that you dont make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment  before you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who you are  supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them  in conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life  it sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now  take one small step at at a time  identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching  meanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing food
1056,my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,parentingrelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,you can move on and not live in the past in the context of your exrelationship but that does not mean moving on from your child moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your expartner as far as is possible for the sake of your childs developmentgenerally its good for a functional nonabusive parent to spend time with hisher child but only insofar as that doesnt cause your child unnecessary stress that requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their childwhats confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or worse not following through on commitmentsbut if one person is exploiting their child to harm their expartner then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to himher depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn when dealing with a hostile expartner your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your expartner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child if you cannot come to an agreement a counselor can help mediate a conversation if thats not an option then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules for which youd have to consult with an attorney

1059,often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me once it starts the thought continues going through my head and i cant get it out  how can i stop these thoughts,behavioral change,anxiety disorders,hi therei first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal studies have been done that show that  of human thoughts are negative so you are not alone i like to think of thoughts as a tornado if you are in a tornado you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial however when you are lets say a mile away from a tornado it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe when unhelpful or scary thoughts arise we tend to start a war with them which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado this makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them so the question i imagine you have is how do i get out of the tornado there are  steps to doing thisget distance from your thoughts by adding i am noticing im having the thought that to the front of them for example i am noticing i am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me   the purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought these thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy the purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you dont get swept away by them you can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky and often the same thought will come back again and again but thats okay just continue to notice it with curiosity i imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely then breathe into them and make room for them our  main emotions are joy sadness fearanxiety shame and anger all of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them so again struggling with them ends up intensifying them instead let them be and make a little bit of room for them often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not the purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense contact the present moment notice what is happening here and now one way of doing this is tuning into the five senses what are some things you hear see taste smell and feel another way is to notice what is happening in your body without trying to change it how deep are your breaths what is happening with your heart rate are you coldwarm etcimplementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely so the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to youi hope this helps
1060,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxietybehavioral change,anxiety disorders,fear is a part of life in fact our five main emotions are joy fear sadness shame and anger we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment as a result of viewing our human emotions as bad or wrong we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us in reality you can do what is important to you while having your fears my question for you is what would you do if this fear was completely gone what behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you what skills knowledge or personal qualities would you develop what kind of relationships would you havei imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you you cant do it until the fear is gone i challenge you to do the following exercisewhat is a goal you would like to achieve example i would like to change careerswhat actions are necessary to complete this goal example see a career counselor to determine my ideal career go back to schoolget a certification network with others in my desired industrywhat thoughts feelings or urges might get in my way example thoughts of what if i fail im not smart enough i cant do it im too busy to put energy into this feelings of fear shame excitement urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking actionit would be helpful to remind myself that example it is natural to have these thoughts feelings and urges but i can take action anyway i deserve to have a fulfilling lifethe smallest and easiest step i can take now example research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersthe time day and date that i will take that first step is example tonight at pm at least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down i hope this helps

1066,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hi there thank you for your question its a great question and one that many people want to know the answer to the short answer is yes counseling can be very helpful to people struggling with many different things there has been a lot of research conducted to prove that counseling is an effective way to help people with mental health concerns life stressors and many other issues in addition there are many people who would tell you that counseling made a positive profound impact on their lives indeed some would tell you that counseling saved their lives now not everyone would tell you that counseling helped but when you think about it there are many medical treatments for a variety of healthcare issues that also do not help everyone so is counseling guaranteed no but it is something that is worth trying if someone is suffering or is just wanting some perspective or support also there is many different types of counseling different counselors have different styles and have different training for various issues this means that you are likely to find someone who has a good style and expertise in an area that you want to work on if you dont know where to go i suggest contacting your states counseling association they can help i think the real question that most people have is how how does it help that question is a bit more complicated because there are many different models of counselingtherapy that work in different ways what i can tell you is that regardless of the model of counseling the relationship between counselor and client is the most important factor i dont mean that the relationship has to be ooowy goowy but it does have to be one where there is trust and openness a counselor will spend time to make sure that you are working together as a team toward a common goal if you go to counseling and you dont feel this is the case tell your counselor an ethical counselor will welcome your feedback i hope this is helpful please ask more questions i hope some colleagues add some other thoughts too be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
1067,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,counselling offers a number of ways to help one to improve their situation  for some this process can take a very long winding path of selfdiscovery while for others they are seeking a purposeful solutionbased way to approach and manage a specific problem its important to remember that there are different styles of therapy some of which will work great with some but poorly with others specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward i often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals on a more specific note there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours  however medication is not an effective way of treating the problem as it treats the symptoms of that problem increased anxiety lowered mood etc and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication

1069,"on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs  i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest 

how do i fix this",selfesteemsocial relationships,mood disorders,sometimes we let our insecurities get the best of us causing us to make some interesting choices honesty is always the best policy but honesty comes with risk  perhaps you may want to start with your family first explaining to them what you have done and why  perhaps they can help you to practice talking about your insecurities with your friends another way is to start slowly to dress more and more like yourself and your true body shape some of your friends may make fun of you true but then you must ask yourselfwhy do you want to be friends with people like that

1075,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,mood disorders,this is a fantastic question in one sentence i would say the followingrecognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality you are separate people each with different wants wishes and desires  if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality could be more or less and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping indicating separate interestsas for ways that may strengthen any relationship even the great ones this is what came to mind there are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details but here are some general ideastry to have at least  minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problemsolvingrealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromlearn to hold on to your own wants wishes and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerset boundaries for what is and isnt acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussiondiscuss how having important discussions can be anxietyproducing and consider having an understanding that if one of you or both of you feels overwhelmed you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time for example you may say okay im feeling really stressed about this right now lets discuss it in an hour and at that time go back to the discussionconsider what your partners top three or four complaints about you may be check in with them and see how accurate you are if you see validity in their responses consider whether or not you may want to make changesdiscover what makes your partner feel loved valued appreciated or specialrelationships are always in progress and constantly changing some anxiety around change is typical being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive name calling fingerpointing or asking each other to change is a true giftyou may enjoy this quote connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen heard and valued when they can give and receive without judgment brene brown

1077,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hi  great question  i believe counseling does help people of course i am a therapist so i would think that   seriously  i think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent  therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone  i like to think of therapy as an unbiased aerial view of our lives someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss hope this helps

why this is happening and what can i do about it",human sexualityintimacy,mood disorders,sexual desire seems to be straightforward  i like someone and i become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them  but that idea does not always take into account other factors stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs  when we are overstressed for example we often find ourselves ill at the same time  can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress additionally focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection  while this may seem counter intuitive it makes sense in the word of stressfinally its never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor as well you did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body as well
1081,every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather  how can i fight this,depression,mood disorders,seasonal affective disorder sad is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons especially fall to winter  everyone suffers with some form of this lessened activity levels increased isolation etc while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression if you have noticed that this happens frequently there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood  its important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools  push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities its easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly  perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights complete with hot chocolate and a fire you may want to consider the purchase of a sad light  these are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin d in our bodies as well as the release of growth hormone which releases when we wake up there are mixed reviews of these products however and they can be expensive
1082,my depression has been reoccurring for a long time it all started when i was being bullied in high school in ninth grade my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates after that i was fine for a couple of years i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work i believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her obviously that wasnt the right choice i regret ever doing that seeing as even though im not selfharming anymore i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed i have a big problem with handling problems in life whenever a problem arises i get stressed and i feel hopeless as if its not going to get better i get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldnt be sad all the time and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones,depressionstress,mood disorders,i couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own  unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage  often when i am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress  when we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly for example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress for example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity  is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementstry to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you

1086,"i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her  but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection  weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago 

why this is happening and what can i do about it",human sexualityintimacy,mood disorders,"this is something i have
had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practices focuses  the answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session  if you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives subjective intersubjective objective and
interobjective  also known as the four quadrants in determining where the
challenges are it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situationin this case from the upperright
or behavioral and physical perspective we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked such as blood pressure  we would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornography next we would look at the
upper left quadrant thoughts cognitions identity feelings to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times  if you are worried about your job your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate this can
contribute to your situation  from there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant cultural rules and tools to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift update andor reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges  it would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your familyculture of origin views the profession finally we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant systems laws
rules of society such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available  once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you needto sum your question then
of why you cant keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after look at
your behaviors look at your physical body for issues look at where you picked
up your rules and tools culture and look at your ability to access goods and
services  they all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account  so  as you can see there is no one possible answer to this but several  i hope this helps"

1090,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,a lot of things affect how helpful counseling is for each person including at least these things but often many othersthe therapeutic alliance this refers to the bond connection or trust between the client and the counselorwhat the person is coming in to work onhow motivated the person is to work on what it is they would like to changesome people also ask how counseling is different from friendship there is a similarity in the sense that hopefully both counselors and friends will listen to what you are experiencing but that is really the end of the similarities some differences arecounselors are specifically trained to phrase questions or statements in ways that help you to gain more awareness of one could be contributing to what it is that you are trying to change both within yourself and possibly with people around youcounselors have experience in using lots of different types of techniques for example focusing on finding solutions looking at how the present situation could relate to your past using roleplays or examples in session to help you learn new skills or ways of looking at situations and probably hundreds of other thingscounselors are taught to look at what you are experiencing and ask questions about other related ideas that you may not have connected to what you are experiencingthere is a treatment plan in place usually after the first second or third session so both you and the counselor have an idea of where you would like to go with counseling what you are hoping to change or learn and a general idea of a plan for getting to your goalsin general i would say the followingyes counseling can help people who want something to be different in their livescounseling is most helpful when the connection between the counselor and the client is strong enough that some trust forms in other words not every counselor or technique is helpful for every persona lot of counselors will talk to you on the phone for a few minutes prior to you coming in for your first appointment to answer any general questions that you may haveif you are working with a counselor and you feel as though you are not clicking or connecting with one another give it three or four sessions before you change trust is not happening in one hour for most of peopleif you are working with a counselor and you would like to be getting more or something different out of it tell the counselor about that because typically modalities can be changedif you are asking this question because you would like help with a specific issue call a local counselor and discuss it so that you could have a more specific answer about possible options for counseling

1096,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,counseling allows us to have a sacred space a space that is set apart from the outside world it is a space of nonjudgement and exploration being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves it allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes our behaviors and our feelings imagine if you will a small goldfish swimming around the usual fish tank although i dont attest to know what a goldfish thinks i would imagine he does not see the world outside of him he only sees the small fishbowl oblivious to the outside world when one comes into the counseling room one is trying to gain insight that was not previously there remember the observer affect one cannot truly act objectively with the world we are in a dynamic relationship with life it reacts to us and we to it the time in the counseling room allows us to gain an understanding that is beyond the normal limits allowing us to see what was before hidden often times in plain sight

1098,my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned she calls me every day complaining but i dont want to hear it anymore,family conflictstress,stressrelated disorders,it is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece you cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being abandoned not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself it is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support in this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain this must be very difficult for you because i hear the stress in your voice almost everyday its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed i feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance when empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional helpafter sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you this means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed this could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite you could then say to her if she complains again i cannot change the way you feel in this situation and i encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what i could do is explain what you could do to helpwwwpsychologyresourceca

1117,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,"i believe that counseling and finding a good therapist
will be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change
improvement and overall growth most counseling involves homework and a level
of commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of
problems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way here are
some of the key ways that therapy can help 
 helps to define the problem and gain a clearer
understanding of where it originates many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are
experiencing these can include feeling sad increased sleeping substance use
panic attacks selfharm isolating ones self academic decline etc often
times people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms having a
therapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where
they come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their
problems 
 allows for a safe outlet to vent
not everyone likes to share their problems with close
friends or family members maybe they dont want others to know of their flaws
maybe they dont want to burden others with their problems or maybe they just
are not comfortable talking about themselves and in some situations people do
not have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no
friends or family while talking with those we know can help bring some relief
it is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and
emotionally removed from given situations counseling gives a safe outlet in
which one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling
judged
 counselors can offer various problem solving solutions

a good therapist usually will not directly point their
client in the direction they need to go counseling is about growth and
teaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies
that will bring about emotional and psychological relief counselors will help
clients to explore the various options available in given situation based on
the clients needs wants and values and will help them to choose the option
that best fits with their desired outcome 
 gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future
problems
many individuals that seek therapy have never learned
good coping strategies perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to
model productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are
overbearing and take away the energy needed to cope different diagnoses
require different tools however some are beneficial for any problem and any
individual these include but are not limited to relaxation techniques
breathing exercises development of healthy routines using mindfulness
improving communication skills and recognizing and changing maladaptive
thought patterns a good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools
will often practice them during session and will assign homework for further
practice and mastery of the skills"

1122,were in an eight year relationship my boyfriend drinks a lot he experienced childhood trauma i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts,anger managementrelationshipssubstance abuseaddiction,mood disorders,first let me extend my compassion to both of you  it sounds like you have a lot on your plates childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us your question is brief so ill just try to give general answers as best i can from my experiences treating many people with your boyfriends experiences the short healthy answer is that you cant fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help he needs a professional period what you can do is take care of yourself with his background it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way your task needs to prioritize your own safety and wellbeing trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries manage his own emotions and behaviors so your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the nearterm certainly not without professional help you might also benefit from help and support to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life i am not blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriends behavior only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship if you have accepted your boyfriends drinking and violent outbursts in the past by staying in the relationship that is likely to perpetuate his behavior and there isnt any way to handle violent outbursts they shouldnt be handled at all and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe then that may be what you will have to do we can never really change anyone else the only person we can change is ourselves sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another persons behaviors but it doesnt control it i would recommend that you work with a professional to first ensure your own safety above all then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to and which you want to separate from whatever your boyfriend does in his life you will be happier if you manage your own feelings set boundaries etc let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery

in the past i have even cheated on my boyfriend while i was under the influence of alcohol 

but now even if i dont do anything wrong and dont embarrass myself i still feel really guilty after a night of drinking i dont understand why im feeling this way does this mean i have a problem",substance abusesocial relationships,mood disorders,hello i commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life it sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic you might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict i dont have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like its begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on i mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis the feedback im writing here is very general and doesnt address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation  one of the ways to think about substance misuse is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance let me repeat that it is a disease of avoidance your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what youre avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on and of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us that means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed if you were unfaithful and often angry thats your first signpost for angry drinkers it is often true that you dont drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger i recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction wishing you the best health and wellness

1136,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having  with your therapist it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy
1137,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience
1138,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,everyone has different experiences going to therapy being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves i would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this that way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor there are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety in individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors as you address your issues then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship
1139,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hi there thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist
1140,my husband and i have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times others have told me that most men would have left me by now honestly i think i have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing i want to be better connected with my husband,human sexualityintimacymarriage,mood disorders,hi there thank you for your openness about the challenge you are experiencing in your relationship sexual intimacy is an important part of many peoples life but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple the first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband its important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants for example asking your husband how often does he want to have sex week or month when having this conversation its important that you are both respectful and open with each other the point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem yet there are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonicfriendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it if you are both on the same page  lack of sex might not be a problem if there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire i would recommend seeing a professional relationship  sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic whats creating it whats getting in a way of connecting sexually and to assist you and your husband in finding creative solutions
1141,im obsessing about a terrible breakup everything is a constant reminder  how do i move on,relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,hi break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time its important that you dont compare yourself to others each and every person will experience this grieving process differently here are a few tips to help with your recovery  make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you friends and family even though you might feel like being alone make an effort to be around them  although you might not feel like it try to take care of yourself as much as possible eat healthily get regular sleep  vigorous or gentle exercise depending on your mood the last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick eg flu is to take care of ourselves even thought thats what we need the most but when we do get that chicken broth sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort thats exactly the same when it comes to emotional pain take care of yourself keep yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster  as much as possible put away reminders of the relationship you might not be ready to throw things out but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet and also block social media reminders there is a lot of wisdom in the saying out of sight out of mind  once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off try out something new in a relationship we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try now its time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new  if possible change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts mindset and forget your ex even if just for a few hours even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders  in addition to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong i would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist
1142,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,normal can be an insidious word to use because it can undermine your sense of worth  it implies theres one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and abnormal if youre not behaving according to that prescribed standard  instead what id recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when youre attending therapy  explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand whats going on thats causing you anxiety  once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it
1143,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hello there  you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal   i realize there a few ways to look at this  i presume you werent anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite  well my initial response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way  have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change  looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen   or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about  this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings  maybe you lack confidence in that therapist   have you let your therapist know how you feel  that would be good to explorei would like to encourage you to look at these ideas  hope it helps   let me knowkindlykeithkeithcounselingcom
1144,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,its normal to feel a little anxietyafter all its an important encounter for you  my suggestion is to discuss this with your therapist let himher know how youre feeling especially if you feel as though your level of anxiety is impacting the quality and benefit of your sessions  you might try some relaxation techniques prior to starting the session deep breathing progressive relaxation core muscle disengagementif youre not familiar with these techniques ask your therapist or write back
1145,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,mood disorders,as far as i can tell you received unwanted attention but you didnt do anything wrong  what did your instructor say anything if the outfit was not appropriate then the instructor should tell youif heshe didnt then assume the swimsuit was okay but the gentleman in the class wanted your attention and took it upon himself to comment in order to get that attention  if you dont want his attention then you have a couple of choiceswear a shirt  over the swim top find an inexpensive swim top to replace the one you have or wear what you have as long as the instructor doesnt say anything and if you get unwanted attention say in as confident slightly loud voice as you can muster  i dont appreciate your critique of what im wearing were here to take a class lets just focus on that then  turn on your heel and walk away
1146,my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,parentingrelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,if you have a good relationship with your child then you have already accepted and been accepted as this childs parent and you have a commitment and an obligation to play that role  if you suddenly absent yourself from this childs life then you may be doing real damage working out an arrangement with the childs mother for regular visits the child can count on and committed to by both parents will serve the best interest of the child which i assume is what both parents are truly concerned with  the visits dont have to be every day once a week even once a month is better than hit and miss with long absences in between  best of luck to you and the fact that you asked the question says volumes about your parenting potential  feel free to follow up with me on line or in person
1147,"im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me 

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time",relationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,have the two of you ever discussed how you feel  i know given the nature of your question thats probably not likely but im going to suggest it any way  he needs to understand that how you feel about this issue equates to not being as happy in the relationship as you could be or he thinks you are  so start there that may be more of an attention getter than you never listen to me yes i do etc  direct opener  im not as happy in this relationship as i think we both deserve  pause and if you wont let me talk about it then its only going to get worse  then explain you dont feel listened to you try to be a good listener but you dont feel you are getting the same in return  if he interrupts put your hand up in the sign of a stop then say please just let me finish  you are right to raise this subject with him because a good marriage cant exist in a communication vacuum in fairness to him he needs to understand the seriousness of your concern and have a chance to do better  if he refuses  tell him you want to seek couples counseling then do it with him or without him
1148,ive been suppressing it for quite some time but there are days when i cant make eye contact with her i think she knows and we both admitted there was some type of vibe but the overall discussion was vague i think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us its driving me crazy as an act of expression i have purchased a gift for her thats personalized i havent given it to her yet,relationshipsworkplace relationships,anxiety disorders,there are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace  sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace

how can i be less dependent on my him",relationships,anxiety disorders,recognizing that youre too dependent on your boyfriend can be a wakeup call and an excellent opportunity to work on your own personal growth and independence  it sounds like its time to explore and develop your own interests and engage in some activities that excite and challenge you  if you have time it could be useful to begin a new activity or class cultivate friendships outside of your relationship with your boyfriend and begin to reflect and meditate on ways to enhance your own personal fulfillment

1155,i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,traumafamily conflict,mood disorders,in general our past is always somewhat alive and does inform our present experiences  all past experiences both positive and negative are what have brought you where you are today physically and emotionally   that being said your fathers behavior does not have to define you or your future  you have power over your life and your future  by learning more about yourself you can learn to incorporate your past into your present life without being defined by past traumas  the best way to grow and learn how to do this is to talk with someone about your experiences  by talking about your past and present struggles with a trusted confidante or helping professional you will hopefully learn how to be at peace with your past

his insecurities are hurting our relationship how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present",relationshipsintimacyspirituality,anxiety disorders,one of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself but you cant make goals for your partner if your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction you can certainly assist him but you cant independently make it happeni wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five   minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening kind of like an investigative reporter so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean when it feels like to to him when this is discussed etc at that point maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as wellalso if he wants to make a change it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached so it is often helpful to have someone there to assistit may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued appreciated special or loved and also consider what makes your fiancé feel that way

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time",relationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,unfortunately you cant directly change another persons behavior however you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you the best way to provide feedback is in  parts the first part is telling him the emotion you are experiencing when he doesnt listen such as hurt sad and unloved i would stay away from feelings such as frustrated angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion the second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way be specific example when i get home and tell you about my day and you dont look away from the tv be objective as possible when you describe his behavior and the last part is the most important tell him what you want him to do and again be specific example i would rather you turn off the tv give me eye contact and reassure me about my day here is an example with all  parts together i feel hurt when you dont say anything to me when i tell you about my fight with my friend i want you to hug me and tell me you understand how i feel hope that helps

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time",relationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,does your husband want to listen to youfind this out by asking him the questionthis way you know whether the goal youd like to reach is even possiblesome partners prefer that one person is the rule maker or the only one who is entitled to talk about themselvesif your husband tells you he wants to listen to you or even that he does listen to you then you can explain in detail the way you define listening which may be very different than his definitionbasically no one can directly change someone into being more openmindedwhat is possible is to tell him your wishes your willingness to be patient while he develops the habit of listening to you and point out that a relationship is more fulfilling when both partners feel they are receiving from the other one
1181,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,therapy does not work overnight oftentimes it is a lifelong struggle the therapists job is not to cure you or to remove something but rather to make you strong enough to live your life with your own peculiarities and struggles remember we are human and constantly fallible another important thing to note is that although you go to therapy that is just a room most of the magic and work takes place in your real life outside of that room

there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal
river the current of the river swept silently over them all  young and
old rich and poor good and evil  the current going its own way knowing
only its own crystal self
each creature in its own
manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging
was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned
from birth
but one creature said
at last i am tired of clinging though i cannot see it with my eyes
i trust that the current knows where it is going i shall let go and let
it take me where it will clinging i shall die of boredom
the other creatures laughed
and said fool let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled
and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredom
but the one heeded them
not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed
by the current across the rocks
yet in time as the creature
refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and
he was bruised and hurt no more
and the creatures downstream
to whom he was a stranger cried see a miracle a creature like ourselves
yet he flies see the messiah come to save us all
and the one carried in
the current said i am no more messiah than you the river delights to
lift us free if only we dare let go our true work is this voyage this
adventure
but they cried the more
savior all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again
he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a savior"
1183,"im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me 

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time",relationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,its hard when you feel as if youre the only one thats taking the time to listen to your spouse but i would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you when you try and talk with your husband sometimes it can be in the way dialogue is approached i would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband see if blame and criticism are present when blame and criticism are included bids for connection can quickly go off track this can sometimes start off with something like why dont you you arent you dont partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack  also become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband sometimes this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another  if you find this pattern continues you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy a trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about whats happening between you
1184,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for  is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,marriagerelationshipsintimacy,mood disorders,feeling alone in your marriage is one of the most painful feelings wanting connection with your spouse yet feeling the all too familiar distance thats keeping you apart can be so hurtful but change is possible you might be able to move closer toward each other on your own but since there has been two years of distance i would suggest looking into couples therapy with a trained couples therapist they are trained in helping couples begin to examine whats been happening that has caused a drift in your marriage im also curious if there was a significant event that occurred around the time you started feeling distant if there was something that occurred during this time that is hard for you both to talk about couples therapy can help with this also it can provide a safe and supportive space for you both
1185,im obsessing about a terrible breakup everything is a constant reminder  how do i move on,relationship dissolution ,mood disorders,dealing with a breakup is difficult we have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives first it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss if we dont allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on so in some ways you dont want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings instead take good care of yourself talk to friends and give your self time to heal the second most important thing is to forgive yourself this is also an important part of taking care of yourself you might be blaming yourself and reliving moments when you wish you would have done things differently by replaying those thoughts you remain stuck when we begin to forgive ourselves we truly begin to heal lastly in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex they are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts this is probably the hardest part for some people but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending if you have a clear ending you can have a new beginning i hope this helps take good care of yourself
1186,"every time i send a message to someone or a group message on instagram imessage or snapchat people will read my messages but then they wont answer me 

could it be that there is something they dont like about me i dont understand why they wont answer my messages how do i get people to respond to me",social relationships,anxiety disorders,i understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you listmore than likely the nonresponse has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messageshave you tried asking a question in your posts  this would be one way to invite people to answer your postwhen you write  imagine yourself as the reader of the postif you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your postgood luck

i get so depressed  because of my dads yelling he keeps asking me why i cant just be happy the way i am and yells at me on a daily basis is this considered emotional abuse",family conflictlgbtq,mood disorders,maybe this is emotional abuseit certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourselfmaybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your gendertheres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this  only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him
1188,im  very depressed how do i find someone to talk to,depression,mood disorders,great that you realize talking with a professional counselor about how you feel would be helpfulif youd like a very fast response by phone then google depression hotline for where you live  and if you have a specific topic which upsets you then google around with this topic to see if there are services specific to your interestif youve got time to invest in looking for the best fit therapist for yourself then google therapy or therapistthere will be many many names which come upi know i sound like i work for google only it is the easiest way to find lots of informationi send you good luck
1189,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,mood disorders,i appreciate your questionthe answer of what makes a good marriage are as varied as there are marriagesbasically similarity like mindedness in beliefs and values makes a good marriage the best chance of getting along with someone on a longterm basis is when two people see life and the world in similar wayseven though opposites attract this is a short lived dynamic which breaks apart when there arent enough similarities in common between the partners
1190,im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her how can i learn how to listen and get myself together,relationships,anxiety disorders,im glad to read about your willingness to develop new ways to invest yourself with your partnerthe easier way to fix a relationship is when both people are helped to recognize the ways the couple dynamic falls short of what each person would likecouples therapy is exactly thisstill relationships can change if one person changes since changing one part of a system will change the system itselfbesides starting to work with a therapist on what you can do differently reflect within yourself on the situations when problems arise between the two of yousee if you can figure out what you wanted and what you partner wanted in that particular moment was one of you trying to help the other and the person felt insulted by the suggestion of needing helpthis is only an example of how intentions are misread or not welcome by one partner from the otheralso keep in mind there is a limit to everyones flexibilityreflecting and selfawareness are the first stepthe second step is to know when youve reached the end of possibilities to change yourself and not be accepted for who you arethis raises the question of whether the two of you are far apart in similarities in order to be happy togethergood luck in enjoying the changes you will try to make
1191,my wife and i got separated because i asked about her contact with a male friend of hers the next day she kicked me out  she let me move back two days later yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind i asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business,marriageintimacy,mood disorders,when threats of leaving such as what you described in your question kicking you out wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship impacting both partners and if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship from the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship if your wife is willing i would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time or for you to talk with an individual therapist if marriage counseling isnt an option
1192,ive only been married three months every week we argue about something and it seems to be getting worse,marriage,mood disorders,one key factor to consider is are you able to repair after your arguments it seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument when couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forward im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over if youre stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about  minutes the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  when things are good between you  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this cycle and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time that way when this is enacted during an argument nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time rather both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs
1193,my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,parentingrelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,i am really glad you reached out when parents get divorced they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child we might divorce our partners however we dont divorce our children if anything our children need to know that we are still a stable force in their lives unfortunately in some relationships children get used as a bargaining piece and i am hearing that may be happening in your relationship you can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child it is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child it is important for your children to have some consistency in his or her time with you for example if you and your ex dont have a parenting schedule it is something that you want to create so that you can not only decide for you when you will see your child but your child can know when you will be available just for her this will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled timesi would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your childs life how you can both be there to help raise her if this is not a conversation that you can have on your own you might seek out help from the court there are parenting experts and mediators who might be able to assist youremember in any discussion keep the focus on what is best for your child and you will be moving in the right directionbest of luck to you
1194,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,it takes a lot of courage to go to therapy  i have gone myself as a counselor and know what that feeling is like this is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist this might be something to bring up to your therapist and openly discuss scary to do but its ok this may even relieve some of your anxiety  if it continues you may want to consider trying another therapist as this one may not be the best fit for you
1195,i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,trauma,mood disorders,first and foremost be gentle and patient with yourself it is normal to feel a range of emotions after a severe trauma including no emotions at all try not to push yourself to feel just notice the lack of emotion you are experiencing right now maybe write about your emotions and the lack of them or talk about it with a safe person unfortunately recovering from trauma can take time and its best done at your own pace if you arent feeling there may be a reason you arent feeling for severe trauma i always recommend working with a trained trauma professional who has the training to guide you on your path to healing fully
1196,"im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me 

how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time",relationshipsmarriage,mood disorders,thanks for reaching out this is a great question communication is definitely a way street one person cannot participate in a discussion it takes a talker and a listener furthermore communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying  since i cant ask you questions about what is going on i am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when i work with couples one person focuses more on solving the issue than listening to their partner  this can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be heardi understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you that can be really frustrating and difficult and i want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationshipone of the best strategies to gettting heard is actually to be a good listener to someone else i know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive right you want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening but this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills in other words you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teachpay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation no texting or distractions lean in focuslisten for content and for emotion clarify what you dont understand try to understand the persons underlying emotions dont rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on encourage the other person to continue speaking nod and vocalize that you hear what they are sayingask questions to get to understand the other persons point of viewi believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills and the other person feels heard they will be more likely to listen to us if you dont find that this doesnt spill over in that way then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it if there is push back from him set up a trial period to just try the skill perhaps for  weeks and see if it helps if communication is really breaking down then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skillsbest of luck to you
1197,"i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with it was brief and turned into us being just good friends

i spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationshipssocial relationships,anxiety disorders,its completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them  when you cross over from friends to a relationship it does change things  some people are very easy going and wouldnt feel threatened by what you did  others would be upset  if your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend then you need to talk about it  each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect  then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship  maybe he wouldnt be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend  or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him  most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward  you didnt do anything wrong because it doesnt sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend  but if you really care about your boyfriend then you probably care about making him upset  instead of looking at this issue as a problem try to look at it as an opportunity to connect  if you can both listen to each other and understand each other your relationship can become even closer

how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it  i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy  what should i do",human sexualitylgbtqintimacy,mood disorders,keep doing the crossdressing since you like ityour problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about itnot keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life  usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about usonce you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing  based on their handling of this intimate part of your life you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to themsecrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time   the person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship felt good or at least not worrisome
1200,i dont know how else to explain it all i can say is that i feel empty i feel nothing  how do i stop feeling this way,depression,mood disorders,your question is very broad because feeling empty can develop for many different reasonsyoure certainly not alone in feeling this waytry to follow the logic of your feelings by asking yourself questions about the empty feeling   doing this may open up a discovery about the reason for the emptiness feelingwhen do you feel empty are there certain situations it happens more often than another what helps the feeling go away what or who is helpful in relieving the empty feelingsometimes people need a little help to get started in understanding how to recognize their feelingsconsider a therapist any disciplined practice which encourages selfknowledge such as some yoga practices and a creative discipline like photography or music as long as you concentrate on increasing your selfunderstanding eventually youll find the answer to your question

1203,every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather  how can i fight this,depression,mood disorders,sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood  in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp to boost your dose of vitamin d when the sun isnt naturally out also consider what is it that the change in weather changes in your life if for example when its sunny you are an outdoorsy active person and when the weather changes youre whole activity level changes along with it you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months
1204,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky  is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics that said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you

1207,im  very depressed how do i find someone to talk to,depression,mood disorders,hang in there feeling depressed sucks but talking with someone can really help  so its awesome that youre already trying to figure out how to find that person tons of good suggestions already but to add my two cents  you can find therapists in your area and read a little bit about them to find someone you like the sound of via this website and also via wwwpsychologytodaycom if you have health insurance your insurer might be able to make recommendations as to therapists covered by your plan or if you happen to be in school the school itself should be able to connect you with either their own counselor or a center that they recommend nearby finding someone can take a few calls or a bit of research so if you need some immediate support or find yourself having thoughts of hurting yourself you can also call the great folks who run the suicide crisis line httpssuicidepreventionlifelineorg  they are great in moments of crisis

1223,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hello yes counseling can be beneficial to many people one of the effective components to effective therapy is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling i dont mean just show up and listen to the counselor for  minutes but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place this requires you to be vulnerable capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly honestly and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals  your improvement of self it does take time and there are no quick fixes usually so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places youll thank yourself later knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process be well
1224,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,i love this question some people shy away from counseling because they think since they already talk about how they feel to their relatives or friends they shouldnt need a counselor however if you are having a difficult time counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on track counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know for one your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do in that way counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation this gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings a counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions over time as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights the work you do is based on you and where you are at oftentimes when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you a counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your planbest of luck to you

1229,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,from the very beginning of counseling sessions i emphasize that the work will and must end at some pointin counseling there is an arc to the process a beginning middle and end i am always digging searching and exploring there comes a point where things come to there natural endingi always leave an opening for continuing counseling in the future at least as a check in
1230,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor  follows through
1231,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,this is a question that is very specific to each person there are definitely some variables but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might endwhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication this depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyim not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning i strongly encourage you to ask about it

1233,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hi there there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship  the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed  all of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last example your question however was about the counselor ending treatment this is a bit more difficult and can be very nervewracking  it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well  its important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something elsein regular openended sessions i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently in these checkins i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely  i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize  in goaloriented sessions i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy  this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery that said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these up in the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you its a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward
1234,how does a person start the counseling process,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hello there are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone  its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away you may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for youregardless of how you go about it i like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back there are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits you
1235,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,there are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated client has met therapy goals client is not progressing  therapist is not a good fit for clientin order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what isnt and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client in these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea
1236,"im in my late teens and live with my dad  the only time i go out is for my college classes sometimes when i see my friends i want to talk with them but sometimes i wont want to talk to them for days or even weeks

1237,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hello the end of the counselorclient relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons among them are the clients inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinicians inability to help the client for a variety of reasons a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere in this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the clients inability to pay that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramountwhen the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journeyrather than some abrupt departure from it an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known albeit perhaps approximate date of when that program will be finished in this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolutioni have always worked in therapy with the following slogan if you will that i learned years ago during graduate school not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality  the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapists desire to truly see the client heal and grow when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward in these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clearultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client which is paramount are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere if both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the clients successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter
1238,how does a person start the counseling process,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hello counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help that said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near futurewhat they are able to pay for out of pocket that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesnt have to stay that way counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way the counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worthonce you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet that first session is often very low key there might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement this document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselors credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details all of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselorin the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous heres a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor its true we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us what makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like were standing on a three legged stool this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers we honestly do not plain and simple counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on lifes road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life so as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy

sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right

are they right am i depressed",depression,mood disorders,the answer to the question of whether or not youre depressed is less meaningful than what you are doing to feel strong and secure in your lifeotherwise people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what theyd like to do with their lives and accept depression as though it is their new namewhat you write sounds like classic depressionwhat to do about this feeling is to get closer to yourself in an accepting way  assume that what you do in daily living is somehow necessary  unless you are doing immoral or illegal actions to other people to accept your own wishes as truth will open you to appreciate why you do what you domake believe youre interesting and find out more about who you are if you have trouble to start with thinking of yourself as worth understandingthe more you appreciate who you are and your unique strengths vulnerabilities and fears the more these will dissolve by what seems on their ownin fact they will disappear bc you are believing in yourself and your waysgood luck

are they right am i depressed",depression,mood disorders,hello being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily we look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth if that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd heres a secret that might help with most of those issues not much of those problems ive just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world if you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others like your peers i can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another persons suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen yearswhen we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress whos popular whos not popular and for the most of it all of that is external so the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside the internal stuff with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside the internal that is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold so fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes in your post you mentioned that you live with your dad are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy it is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause it is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better without causing harm to yourselfhave you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so do you have a friend who is your best friendsomeone who is there for you no matter what if not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors they are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful its called teen line httpsteenlineonlineorg it helped me when i was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well you might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area if you want are in washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling you might also check with your school for assistancedont be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel adults dont always have a handle on it either being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty but you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it i wish for you the very best and bright future

i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substance abuseaddiction,mood disorders,it can be challenging to quite anything once we set our mind to it  we often crave the things more that we know we can not or should not have  with that being said i would encourage you to become aware of the chemical dependency part that cigarettes have on your brain and your body  then make yourself aware of the mental part the habit part  often times people will engage in smoking again just from the mere social aspect of it  make yourself aware of these and devise a plan of the things you will do instead of going out on smoke breaks or the ritual of smoking in the car on on the back porch  there are plenty of support groups out there to help with this as well  smoking cessation is a good resource

i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substance abuseaddiction,mood disorders,quitting smoking can be difficult its also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way from the way that you wrote this it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically but still have cravingsone thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or obgyn about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings sometimes that can very helpfulas far as the more emotional or mental piece these things come to mindsometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy there are sometimes toys like those available at office playground that may help to keep you physically occupiedthere can also be changes or additions to your routine because i imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead the list is endless but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise with the permission of your doctor just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well completing a puzzle learning a new activity that requires using your hands painting or knitting perhapsanother piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes perhaps irritability depending on what it is that you may be feeling  learning other strategies to use can be helpful as wellthis can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change i would recommend that if things do not become easier for you consider talking with a therapist then you could not only have some more strategies or ideas directly related to you but you could have very direct support for what you are trying to doi give you a lot of credit

if you work with a therapist who is skilled then saying goodbye can be just as
transformative as the therapy itself ending therapy is also known
as termination i know termination doesnt have a great ring to it
however it is what it is it is an ending of the relationship as it existed
it is reality cold and stark of course when i talk to clients i dont use the
word termination i usually say our goodbye  under what circumstances does therapy usually
end therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is not
receiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to work
with a particular therapistin the best case scenario
the decision to move on from therapy and say our goodbyes happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up  ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session what i mean by that
is there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently so the first session i
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve now sometimes there are
situations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may take
that personally it is hard when any relationship ends and it might bring up
feelings of sadness and fear or abandonment any good therapist will end the
relationship based on what is right for the client what are some situations
where a therapist might end the relationshipif the situation the client
is dealing with is out of the therapists scope of practice the therapist may
end the relationship and refer the client to someone else this is in the
clients best interest another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful  a therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce a good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else this is good practice
and helps the clientif a client is actively
suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the
relationship and refer out for a higher level of care the client may need to
be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program
therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after
the intensive program is completed 
ending therapy should be a
time for connection and bringing together accomplishments or reviewing the
next important step the client needs to take it should not be an experience of
abandonment a skilled therapist will help a client gain a new perspective on
closure for some clients it may be the one time in their lives when they get
a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of
control on creating that ending good luck to you"

1271,"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want  things like you arent worth anything  i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it

what is wrong with me and how can i stop having these thoughts",diagnosis,anxiety disorders,those  critical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you at a very young agewhen we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us feels accurate we absorb their opinions as our ownyour question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinionsnothing is wrong with you everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of viewstart the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which dont feel truethen replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your ownafter a while of doing this youll either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true
1272,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit and the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not it is best to have ongoing dialogue with the client to determine when termination is appropriate
1273,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professional ethicscounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,there are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling  a major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client  this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time  if the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy  the process of termination must not injure the client and if necessary the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities  another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care  if the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else he or she may need a higher level of care  in this circumstance the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit  a third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship  for example if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship  in this instance the clinician should refer the client to another therapist  finally if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment the clinician and client should terminate treatment
1274,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,each counselor will have their own list of difficulties in doing therapy work with a client  even if clinically trained similarly since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humanson my list is when the emotional pain i feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another feels very deepsometimes i feel like avoiding the pain i feel by asking questions which will steer the conversation away from the painful areas the client talks aboutwhat in fact is necessary to clear out their pain is to step further into so as to realize their emotional pain isnt greater than who they are
1275,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,yes counseling can help peoplehow this happens is bc the counselor can guide the person or couple into deeper areas of their thoughts and emotions than the person or partners would typically avoid or not even realize they are avoidingalso a counseling session offers emotional safety because the therapist will intervene with thoughtful questions if someones strong emotions overwhelm themthis is different than in everyday circumstances  when someone feels overwhelmed by their own or someone elses feelings there is no one who asks reflective questionslast people get better in therapy because often therapy is the first time the person has a chance to trust someone with their confidential information and know this information will always be protected

my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do",family conflictparenting,anxiety disorders,hello it sounds like you and your parents are not balanced in your communication and awareness of expectations your growth is not only reflected in your ability to understand and apply new knowledge and skills it is also reflective of your parents acceptance of your understanding and application have you tried talking with your parents to let them know your concernsthis talking is best when face to face and during non active conflict  cant begin stating rules during an argument etc sometimes it is even helpful to write down ways you feel you can be supported by them and supportive to them maybe share this list or reflective piece with them to review or use when communicating the expectations unfortunately until there are clear expectations stated and expressed the scale will be uneven and frustrations will increase dr t
1279,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,after meeting a client many counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor if you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us the better we understand what it is that bothers you what you would like to get out of the counseling and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals how the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling and that information is too much for this little post

i have anxiety and i had a rough childhood but now ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but i dont know how to stop or even why im doing it 

how can i help myself to change my behavior",behavioral changeanxiety,anxiety disorders,hello i have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you in other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of kneejerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior do you feel good after you have done it the behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so i would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury if none exists this obviously doesnt excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your sidewhen we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place in the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated no closer to solving the issue when we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions so the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at ussometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm wouldnt you agree so i would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunityreach out if you need helpthere will likely be a hand there waiting for you
1285,every winter i find myself getting sad because of the weather  how can i fight this,depression,mood disorders,one theory is that instead of fighting your feelings accept your sad feelings and work with them   feeling sad may open many doors to reflect and make peace with the source of your sadnessalso i believe fighting against the natural cycle of rest and hibernation may not even be possible to succeed   winter for most creatures is a time of withdrawal and slowdown  our bodies and moods are part of nature as well  fighting what is part of nature seems like a tiring fight which the person will loselast point there are the winter holidays to break up the dark and cold of winter   maybe you can invent some of your own winter celebrations so youll have a few gatherings to look forward to hosting

do i have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility",family conflictlegal  regulatorysubstance abuse,anxiety disorders,the answer depends on what state you livesince the description you write here is that your brother may be a serious risk to himself and others it is worth contacting a mental health hotline or one of your local area hospitals and talk to a social worker or other professional level person in their psychiatry department  ask the same question you posted here   your question is a good one and merits serious follow through

1290,"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want  things like you arent worth anything  i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it

what is wrong with me and how can i stop having these thoughts",diagnosis,anxiety disorders,first off there is nothing wrong with you  in fact having random thoughts we feel we cannot control is actually quite common and normal  sometimes our thoughts think they are protecting us if we think we arent worth anything it wont hurt when we get rejected but they are actually doing quite the opposite  they are keeping us stuck and creating a selfprophization  if i think i am not worth anything i dont have to try and i will keep proving to myself that i am not worth anything  there are many techniques to work through and start to change our negative selftalk  there are actually many selfhelp workbooks that can help with this as well  a technique i like to use is meditation or mindfulness  this can teach us to accept our thoughts not fight them and then learn to let them go  release the power they have on us  if we can learn to release these and not ruminate on them this will give us the space to allow more positive and supportive thoughts to come in  mantras can help with this as well i am worth a lot i am important i have value  saying these to yourself everyday over and over even if at first you dont believe can retrain our brains to believe it and allow us to believe it  i have even wrote positive mantras to myself in my bathroom mirror so i am forced to look at these throughout the dayplease remember to not be hard on yourself as you begin to attempt to change the automatic thought patterns  it took a while for you to get where you are and it will take a while for this change to kick in and feel normal  so allow the process to happen slowly and allow yourself to accept you as the amazing and brave person you are

in the past i have even cheated on my boyfriend while i was under the influence of alcohol 

but now even if i dont do anything wrong and dont embarrass myself i still feel really guilty after a night of drinking i dont understand why im feeling this way does this mean i have a problem",substance abusesocial relationships,mood disorders,speaking with a licensed therapist will help you figure out if indeed you have a problem or not  i would say the first question you should ask yourself is why you are drinking the second would be why you feel the need to drink in excess it may be due to a life event or the crowd you are running with  either way a therapist will be able to help you through this as you already made the first step in admitting you are having a difficult time
1292,my boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction we recently got into a fight and he has become very distant  i dont know what to do to fix the relationship,relationshipsaddiction,anxiety disorders,i would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been or more importantly you have felt that he is  this will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyones perception can be different remember that relationships take work and take communication
1293,how does a person start the counseling process,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,i think it is important that you are able to convey what you are looking for in a therapist even if that changes over time  you need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need  to many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to reengage  remembering you are basically hiring someone to help you so i would treat it as such do some research and be clear as to why you are coming to therapy and ask questions as how they will be able to help you

1297,shes my stepmom im pretty sure shes illegally buying the drugs and hiding them from my dad,substance abuse,mood disorders,i would suggest having a conversation with your dad and then having a conversation as a family with your stepmom  usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed  be aware of behavior changes and mood swings  be supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for help
1298,i recently lost a friend to suicide  im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,grief and losssubstance abusetrauma,mood disorders,first i am so sorry for your loss  most people go through the grieving process  i would get a better understanding of what that process is  everyone has their own way of handling loss  you are taking the first step in realizing that you are having a difficult time coping with it  i would reach out to a therapist that has experience treatment patients with loss i would also recognize that drinking and smoking are both substances that will not make depression or depressive thoughts any better
1299,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,social relationshipssubstance abuse,mood disorders,your friend needs to admit they have a problem  if not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more  it is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested  in other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them  like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways  i would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation  encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her
1300,my boyfriend and i recently broke up one week we were fine and the next he told me he needed space he completely deleted me out of his life he does have an opiate addiction he claimed he was sober but since weve split ive heard many lies from him could he be using again and does this addiction affect the mind,relationshipsaddictionsubstance abuse,mood disorders,studies have proven that addiction affects the brain there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well  i would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns  not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals  being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationships
1301,"i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with it was brief and turned into us being just good friends

i spent the weekend with him and  it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationshipssocial relationships,anxiety disorders,the most important thing to ask yourself here is how did this action affect my relationship and is it worth the consequences regardless of your intentions in this action your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior from here we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as is worth harming the relationship you currently have it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes many times it just gives the wrong impressions it is very possible that your partner may believe that since you spend so much time with them that they are still a contender for the most intimate relationship you have to offer and truth be told they kind of are the best intimate relationships are friendships first and foremost it is also a good thing to consider what you are getting out of the relationship with your ex that you are not getting out of the relationship with your current boyfriend if you go to this person for emotional support before your boyfriend then it is very likely youre involved in some emotional infidelity when we turn to others instead of our partner it is as if we ran into another persons arms instead of theirs no matter who you are that hurts

sometimes i feel im not worth knowing or im never going to do anything right

are they right am i depressed",depression,mood disorders,although some people managing depression feel sad or down  it is a possible to have depression without an obvious sad mood  many people indicate that they feel numb or flat  people managing depression often have low motivation they may stay in bed for long periods of time and only get up for absolutely necessary activities  people with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame   if you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks i recommend that you see a counselor to get a more indepth evaluation   the symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression and with a bit of support you could regain energy and improved selfesteem  the stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a label of depression seem scary  the important thing to remember is that mental health disorders are as important as and as treatable physical health disorders    hang in there  healing is possible
1303,how does a person start the counseling process,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,approaching a counselor can seem intimidating at first but most mental health professionals want to help you feel safe and heard  you can often find counselors using search engines like counselchat or psychology today  these websites allow you to get to know therapists before you take the next step  these days counselors have websites where you can learn even more  these websites usually have clear instructions for contact  typically you can reach out via phone or email to request a consultation  during a consultation call you can ask the therapist questions about their credentials and areas of expertise  if you feel like you connect you can schedule a first session where you will tell them more about yourself and why you are seeking therapy  the thing to remember is that therapists want you to reach out to them and they are happy to be approached for support  good luck

1306,how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy now that theyre gone i feel sad its been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent,depressionrelationships,mood disorders,hello so someone made you happy but is no longer around i am sure that feels devastating as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life happiness is formed within ourselves all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary even relationships fo not last forever if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemwhat i would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself what do you like about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi wish you happiness for every day of your lifebest wishes

my mother forced my father out of my life so i do not know who he really is weve gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much i look like her when in fact i look more like him  this makes me mad because i dont want to look like my mother i hate her all that she did was bring me down and make me homeless which she was successful at  i need guidance in my life  i dont want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and its not healthy im dying to make our relationship healthy ive never wanted anything more than this please help me i need your advice",domestic violenceanger managementselfesteemmarriagefamily conflict,mood disorders,hello it sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage i cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent there are no easy answers to your questions and i wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain but i can maybe give some thoughts and reflections first and foremost cut yourself some slack no one is perfect we fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop you probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach you have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsjoining a marriage support group can also be helpful you can find these through local counseling resources sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful if you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youlastly parents are imperfect yepits true they had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage we limp along and do our best having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us the bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life both with ourselves and toward other people so this becomes a guiding principle in our actions it may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit  i am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it if only one of you cares then  of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person thats not fair so be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution all of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life one way or the other you will benefit from itbe well

1309,how does a person start the counseling process,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,the easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful there are lots of counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that check out their website social media and any reviews but remember people are not always very nice if you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services look for one that is in your network you can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurances website if your coverage isnt that great and you know youre going to be paying for it all anyway because youre an allstar and verified your coverage already with the insurance company then you can really pick any counselor you want but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible if you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once youve started counseling better is a good option once youve found a counselor you think is a good fit for you normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment with many counselors you can now send an email but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic once youre all scheduled they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there from there all you have to do is show up

now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal",parentingchildren  adolescents,anxiety disorders,helloit sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior    its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on   you are clearly an observant and hands on  mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is okthis is a tough question to answer without more information   with that said  i have found that under stress people regress  in other words  many people  children and adults alike  often regress and behave differently  as if they were younger than their actual age  when under stress    therefore  my first question would be  has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress   this could be anything from conflict at home  recent changes such as moving  divorce  a loss of some kind  switching schools  or losing a friend or friends    additionally  sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers  they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence     i would suggest that you think about what stressors  changes may have occurred recently  you may also want to check in with her teacher s to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughters behavior at school i also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her  something as simple as  i have noticed that you arent spending time with the friends you used to hang out with  it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately   am i right about that   and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as  did something happen with your friends that  is making you not want to be with them has something been bothering you lately  are you feeling upset or worried   if she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say  i know that sometimes when i feel stressed or worried  i tend to act a little differently  sometimes i withdraw from my regular group of friends  or i get cranky and feel less like myself   i wonder if something like that is happening with you  if you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and  or her teachers  perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might  help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times  or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively  the more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter  including any changes or new stressors   any possible patterns to this behavior  if school has become more difficult socially and or academically  the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her good luck   i believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of childrens behavior  i do though think that you will feel more assured about this  if you can get to the bottom of whats going on 
1365,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hi  this is an excellent question    i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist   in my work with people  once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the persona concerns and the issues they want help with  i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the clients current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress   i would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track  we would then discuss the best plan to address the clients concerns   usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful    i always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this  i tell them that i would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they wont try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me  i want to be helpful and while i have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies i really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and dont like  agree with or not agree with when i share my thoughts about a treatment plan   we the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful  but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along   if things arent improving  i am very happy and willing to try something new  i hope this is helpful for you 
1366,i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,anxietycounseling fundamentals ,anxiety disorders,hi there   as someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for  years  i would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all  almost every single person i have worked with has cried at one point or another  starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe   you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before  i have seen  people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard   i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving   i can assure you that most  if not all  therapists expect clients to cry  and there is nothing to be embarrassed about   crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down   crying is  often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal so  to summarize  dont worry at all about crying it will probably feel uncomfortable  at first  but i promise you  you will not be judged for crying in therapy   and it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and wont judge you good luck 
1367,my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,parentingrelationship dissolution ,mood disorders,the thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life children have a way of making things their fault even when they have done nothing wrong because of this when parents cut off contact the child thinks its their fault as hard as that already is for a child it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life this makes the belief even more strong for them they start to think why does dad keep leaving what am i doing to keep making him go awayi believe a child needs both parents in their life whether she used you for a child or not that child still exists and never asked for this they didnt ask to be born into drama and two parents that cant make things work you can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child if you start over far away this may mean less visits but youll still be a part of their life just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it every child deserves that much good luck to you 
1368,my grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment,parentingfamily conflict,anxiety disorders,absolutely not it is never in a childs best interest to use humiliation as punishment this can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the childs social relationships kids have a hard enough time to then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable the entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful healthy adult you do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake discipline shouldnt be seen as punishment it should be seen as a way to teach a lesson what lesson could this possibility be teaching him absolutely nothing meanwhile she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions she should be one of the people he can come to when hes hurting not someone who causes him pain
1369,my boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction we recently got into a fight and he has become very distant  i dont know what to do to fix the relationship,relationshipsaddiction,anxiety disorders,im sorry you have tension between you and your bfa relationship means two people who relate right   if only one person does all the work to change their approach what they expect what they offer the other then this becomes the new problem to solveif youve already done a significant amount of reflection and change in the way you relate to him then the next step may be to be patient as long as possible while he decides what to change about his part in the relationship toward yousubstance abuse recovery requires profound effort and reflection  if it is successful then the result will show very different qualities in your bf than the ones you know currentlyhe may be so absorbed in the recovery that he can only concentrate on this   of course if the fights persist and you have been patient for what feels too long then there are different questions to address

what might be the long term effects on an adult with this childhood history",family conflictparentingchildren  adolescents,anxiety disorders,the true answer is no one can really say with certaintythe variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  all anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guessthe only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go throughsome people become great teachers therapists and philosophers who have this background  some give up on life and hide away from othersthe best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth
