271,1206,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,substanceabuse,your friend needs to admit they have a problem  if not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more  it is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested  in other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them  like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways  i would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation  encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her,1,1,634,F,0.5906758308410645

279,1445,im in a relationship but i feel like im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated my ex told me that i will never find anyone else and thats lingering in the back of my mind,relationships,the most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter thats why it didnt work with him btw he wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered however it ended clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you so here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message move on you arent unworthy you just havent found a man who is worthy of you to be worthy of you he must see your worth often though before anyone else can see your worth you have to believe it,1,1,610,F,0.7012293338775635

285,958,my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now throughout the entire first day that we met he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another that same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed the next two days were a repetition of the first day on the third night my mother finally caught us and i was kicked out of my house i left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple it was very hard for us his stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month after that it was a downward spiral we were constantly arguing about money food and our families we kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument after six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started one afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one he told me to let him leave or he would hit me he had once promised he would never touch me so i challenged him to do it he slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me i havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now i dont live with him i dont depend on him and we dont have children we both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly he always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i dont ever make the effort to try to be okay ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me i know he has to change that on his own i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned is there hope for a better future together,domesticviolence,hi winters i learned a long time ago that i cant ever predict who will change and who wont i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change only you can decide how many years to give it i see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though what are you waiting foralthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change it doesnt work that way just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work you can only decide when youve paid too much i bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you hes not your only support,1,1,972,F,0.9705402255058287

292,1309,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,thanks for your question  communication is essential between couples and often times gets neglected in relationships  working with your husband to help him become a better listener and consequently a better communicator is going to take some work from your part  you have to calmly be able to express to him your concern and how it affects you  very important is that you do it in a loving and nonthreatening way  therefore the time to have this discussion is not when you are frustrated or need to vent to someone about something important  focus the discussion on how both of you could benefit from having more meaningful conversations where both parties are being heard and how it is important to you that he hears you just like it is crucial for him to be heard  there is a lot of useful information online about how to be a good listener or therapist in your area that can help you  be patient and genuine and he will come around  best of luck mirella,1,1,956,F,0.9282721877098083
