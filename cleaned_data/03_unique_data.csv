   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,it is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to and need to address in counseling  i have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration there is often an underlying fear that they  cant be helped or that they will be too much for their therapist i dont know if any of this rings true for you but most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not  people have numerous significant stressors in their lives  lets face it life can be complicated therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress  you can never have too many issues to address in counseling  all of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling,1,1,960

208,my motivation has gone away its hard to get out of bed i really dont know what to do anymore im miserable my anxiety and depression have taken over my life,depression,anxiety and depression are challenging experiences to live with and to manage on a daily basis i would say that both are challenges to overcome but solutions to living healthy and well exist step  talk about it with friends family partners counselors and other trusted people in your life step  create a plan with a counselor to learn new skills that help you recognize and manage your symptoms step  dont give up working on yourself can be difficult and hard at the beginning stick with it and you will be able to find exercises tools and resources that help you live well,1,1,573

216,im currently up paranoid about well everything i cant get to sleep and i have a feeling of being watched constantly i have extreme depression and anxiety id really like to not be this paranoid and go to bed ive tried night lights ambiance and warm baths,depression,what kinds of things help you to feel safe  i think its great youve already tried a few things to help yourself sleep even if they dont work  those methods of coping could be targeting something other than paranoiawhich is maybe why you arent finding those things are helpful  if you are really struggling sometimes meds can help to calm the brain a bit  if you choose this route make sure you give your prescribing doctor all the information about your symptoms so your meds can be as accurate as possible for what youre dealing withif you have access counseling could be beneficial as well  there are more and more counselors becoming available via telehealth because of covid so you could even find someone to help you right in the space you feel most paranoid about given that space is private  either way talking some of those fears through could at the very least bring some insight if not some relief,1,1,907

219,im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,depression,one of the ways a diagnosis is helpful has more to do with health providers having a common language with which to discuss their patients arriving at a diagnosis requires gathering quite a bit of data on an individual which includes observation i would not recommend selfdiagnosing as it could be challenging for an individual to be objective no matter how much research they have done further i do not believe in pathologizing individuals nor would i recommend anyone pathologize themselves,1,1,491

   i have trust issues low self esteemban extreme fear of abandonment and i constantly reevaluate my relationships i also dont know who i am as a person im not happy overall but im not suicidal can i just feel happy",depression,sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just describedteenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness  the fact that you recognize your great range of feelings as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be is healthyalso healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problemone path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolvedo you have trust issues because someone broke your trust youre entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person   even if the person never offers this to you to know you deserve to be restored to whole may help you feel more securethe same is true with the other topics abandonment and relationships generallythe more you continue to value your unique understanding expectations and standards the more likely youll create relationships which do not have these qualities and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way,1,1,1173

259,i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,depression,it is hard to make a definite diagnosis however i would say  that it could be and or a combination of depression stress ptsd etc  more background information would have to be needed  one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms  if what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out  that would not be good when they do  get help before they do,1,1,474
262,people who are parental figures in my life have in the past hurt me and some continue to do so it makes me feel like im not good enough for my husband or the life he provides me i have had jobs but i am going through a lot of my past garbage and trying to figure out when it all went wrong any time i bring these things up i am expected to be over the issue these are people that you cant just cut out but i have never received apologies for so much of my pain i dont know what to do any more i dont know who i am anymore,depression,it sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life you are feeling invalidated it also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued in working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you,1,1,477
263,i am going through a very hard time and im so depressed my parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening i want to lull myself,depression,consider yourself quite normal for feeling overwhelmed and depressed about your parents divorce   this is the most natural way to feel at this timedepending on how old you are and whether you live under their roof  are dependent on their support and are either part of the decision or not of with whom and where you will live start considering these pointshow did you find out about the upcoming divorceare either of your parents reluctant to answer your questions or is it clear that neither of them want to talk about anything with youwhatever your fears and questions about your own future these are all real  it is necessary for you to know about your basic futureif you are living on your own and the main problem is your inner adjustment that your family structure is completely changing then probably a good therapist would be a great help to you now to clarify these tensionssending lots of good wishes for an easy resolution to your new path,1,1,950
264,ive been depressed for quite a while ive been trying to work through it and my boyfriend has been my rock he is honestly the only person i trust enough to talk to about anything but he decided to break up with me because of my depression i cannot afford to see a therapist or anything so he saw no hope in staying with me my insurance has a  deductible so im screwed ive had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job i have no one my family doesnt care about me they kicked me out when i turned  a few years ago i had friends but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me my exboyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time i see or hear him i break down into tears i found out that i will never be promoted now because of my depression,depression,it sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress social anxieties etc for our depression but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit depression is allencompassing and based on what youve written the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways  the best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive i would recommend contacting your employee assistance program eap if offered by your employer if not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization if however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist as long as your therapist is trained in cognitive behavioural therapy or cbt such as mind over mood,1,1,1123
265,i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancée,depression,sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too  i would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger  i would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard  its hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them,1,1,434

273,im not the same anymore i dont know how to get back to who i am im sad and confused and angry and tired i dont sleep well,depression,being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad confused or angry among other emotions if youre having difficulty sleeping try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed if you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed hopefully youll be able to establish a patternsometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changesif youre still struggling consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician there are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you,1,1,908
274,over the years i have slowly lost everything my jobs my cars my freedom and my money i am a stayathome mom who doesnt make any money doesnt have a car never goes out and cleans all day long everyday,depression,there are an infinite number of possibilities here you included a lot of things that you dont have is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together i dont know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the futurei wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you i dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted if you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happenalso again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room for example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe  minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do,1,1,1196
275,two years ago i was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues it has emotionally destroyed me i now basically hate myself its embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone my family has been in the armed forces and it has always been my dream i cant do this alone anymore and now my family is even worried,depression,it sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you it takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of supportis there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life i dont know what else your life involves whether you have close friends or a romantic partner a career activities that you like to do and many other things you may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different directionyour military service will always be a part of you thank you for your service,1,1,700
276,i feel depressed even though i act like a happy with my family i act like im happy so my son doesnt see me sad i act like my life is a happy life but i feel sad and depressed i sometimes think of killing myself and that my family deserve someone better than me i just cry and write in my book all these feelings,depression,it sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time i would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist if you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment please call  and talk to someonewhile i follow that you would like your son to be unaware of what you are going through that doesnt mean that you cant discuss your feelings with someone else who is it that you trust or could speak with about this a therapist could be one person but perhaps there is someone else in your life as wellone thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy this could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it if you think about this time while holding onto the bead the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy you could do the same thing for a time when you felt comfortable and safehave you recognized any patterns for what is leading you to be sadcan you think of anything that makes you feel good even if it only works for a few minutes,1,1,1165

366,i dont remember when the voices in my head started but i remember hearing them when i was little    i know its not normal to hear voices that arent your own i fight the voices and i want them to stop theyve been here so long and i want them gone how can i make the voices stop,anxiety,you are valid   it is very unnerving when thoughts control your life  one way to combat them is to figure out whose voice the words are said in oftentimes people say things to us and it stays with us and it is not often true  we let others opinions penetrate our brains and live rentfree in our heads  you could try to rewrite the thoughts the negative thoughts rewrite them in a positive way   for example you are not worth anything you could rewrite that in a way that shows all the ways you are worthy  write all your accomplishments and things you have overcome and proof that you are in fact worthy because you are  you can  interrupt the thought focus redirect elsewhere if you are replaying a specific moment you could go back into that moment and retell the moment rewrite the moment so that it is what you would rather it have been your mind does not know anything other than what we feed it feed and integrate more positive thoughts and actions into your routine to possibly see a positive change a change for the better this video could be beneficial for you  negotiating with inner critic,1,1,1100
369,i have a friend who i became quite close to close enough for us to insult each other lightly for humor but eventually that went too far recently ive realized that it is causing me lots of stress and anxiety i cant get away because i fell in love with them,anxiety,sending you positive vibes as you contend with loving someone who bullies you  have you discussed how this leads you to feel and if they can stop open honest communication is a key cornerstone in relationships  take away the bullying and list the other qualities about them you love also write down the pros and cons of staying versus leaving if possible dig into what leads you to love someone who bullies you  were you bullied by someone you love in the past and this resonates because it is familiar also please journal if you wish around the graphic enclosed,1,1,562
370,i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,anxiety,a good way to start is the language or self talk that is happening inside your mind  looking at your question when it is said that the presentations make me feel stress you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self  the presentations cannot give or take away your stress thats something only you can do and you can do it   what language can you change in your self talk  for example are you saying i cant speak in front of an audience ill fail  that sounds a lot different than i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud i can ace this presentation  although this is a short answer i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence,1,1,768
374,im dealing with imposter syndrome in graduate school i know that by all accounts i am a phenomenal graduate student and that i am wellpublished i am well liked by students and faculty alike and yet i cannot shake the feeling that im going to be found out as a fraud    how can i get over this feeling,anxiety,it sounds like you are on the right track recognizing these nagging thoughts of self doubt as imposter syndrome is a huge step in the right direction  from what you have written here it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome   continuing to remind yourself of what you have accomplished and looking at the facts at hand can help diminish doubt  remember many successful people battled imposter syndrome on the way to the top and still manage it  it might be helpful to read some of their stories so that you dont feel alone  the cut has a great article on  famous women on impostersyndrome and selfdoubt   business insider has a great article about men and the imposter syndrome too  remember if you jumped through all of the hoops to get into school and get published you belong,1,1,871
381,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,take small steps each day go around a few people  take a walk and smile or wave at others  strike up a conversation in the grocery aisle  think of topics you enjoy and would like to share could talk about to break the ice maybe call some friends you once had and reconnect go at a pace that feels comfortable and in time you could release the reclusive energy to embrace a more social you  this video could be beneficial also   how to make friends as an adult,1,1,459
388,"i recently broke up with my boyfriend after being together for over  years i truly believe i did the right thing but omehow being single now has made me very needy and unsure of myself
    i am seeing someone casually and i am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation
   how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career relationship status etc",anxiety,possibly you havent completed your phase of mourning the recently passed relationship and lifestyle which surrounded itrelationship breakups mean a persons entire life goes through an adjustment since the relationship impacted all areas of your lifegive yourself some patience to restore yourself from the old relationship when you feel whole again then more than likely you will lose some of the anxiety wondering what your new casual partner feels about youand instead of wondering  you may simply decide to ask the person your question,1,1,538
396,i know this fear doesnt make sense how can i overcome it,anxiety,we often feel people are judging us because we are judging ourselves  investigating how you feel about yourself your own self confidence can be a segway into why you feel others are judging you and also why others opinions matter and if you are using that as the scale by which you estimate the total sum of your worth,1,1,318
399,"when im in large crowds i get angry and i just cant deal with people i dont really like other people i prefer animals they make me nervous and scared
   i lay awake at night thinking and having conversations in my head and i almost always end up making myself feel terrible and crying i have more conversions in my head than i do with actual people    i dont know whats wrong with me and why i feel this way what should i do",anxiety,"what about large crowds leads you to feel angry i can
understand your not liking or enjoying being around other people  animals are often more compassionate  it sounds like you experience a lot of social
anxiety  would you feel comfortable
starting out with smaller groups of people maybe people who share your
interest especially around animals 
maybe practice topics of conversation you feel confident to discuss
which could take the pressure off being in a social setting",1,1,480
418,"i have been with my boyfriend for more than a year he recently got a new job and travels a lot im not used to him being gone all the time i feel as though he has forgotten about me because he does not talk with me as much and doesnt keep me up to date on everything that he does throughout the day which he used to
 i feel lost sad and unwanted this is really a tough new challenge i just want to break up with him but i love him so much i dont know why he is acting this way lately i believe i have separation anxiety is there anything that i can do to help me cope with this while he is out of town",anxiety,relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard it makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship and youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling it can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible if you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feelingas far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but i highly recommend an app called selfhelp for anxiety management theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety the best part is its free,1,1,1153
421,i often get the feeling that im being watched like video cameras are hidden wherever i am even at home i feel like people can see all that i do and are reading my thoughts things i read or hear on the radio seem to be about or meant for me and people are talking about me when they whisper,anxiety,it sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored with no privacy even in your own mind and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience but you may be able to get insight into that as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way with the help of a good therapist there is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away though it might however there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life,1,1,702
422,i feel insecure in my life i dont think my wife truly wants our relationship even though she says she does i have turned to drinking to help relieve my repressed stress about this and other issues i have had a drinking problem for a few years i feel the reason i drink is not just because i like to but because i have lately been on edge ive been very oddly emotional when watching movies that i have been watching for years im paranoid about driving on main roads im very jumpy at the slightest noises,anxiety,sorry hearing about the big amount of stress which you are feeling at this timesince a lot of your stress is directed to uncertainty of whether your wife is happy being with you would you consider continuing the conversation with her about your understanding of her answer to youyour observation that she says one thing and behaves in a different way is meaningfulbringing your point to her attention would at the very least demonstrate her interest in showing and explaining her viewpoint about youbasically youd be expecting her to care about you and how she handles herself with this question may clarify what youre trying to find outthe good news about your relationship with alcohol is that you realize youre overdoing itfrom what you write the emotional pain and helplessness you feel currently seem too much to know about all at onceone possibility is to accept your feelings of hurt and insecurity  this is the first step of working with them   if they start feeling overwhelming then maybe too you can distract yourself for a while from the intensity by engaging in an activity that is not selfharmingafter all you are the most important person in your life so keep yourself safe and healthy,1,1,1200
423,i constantly have this urge to throw away all my stuff its constantly on my mind and makes me feel anxious i dont sleep because im thinking about something i can get rid of i dont know why i do it i started years ago when i lived with my dad then i stopped when i moved in with my mom years later it has started again,anxiety,since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parentplay in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this  are you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things  im only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarilyanxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives  so pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years   possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parentbasically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released,1,1,968
424,i have anxieties about everyday stressors ie finances work relationships kids and maintaining a household,anxiety,i encourage you to look at two things  what you can do behaviors to better manage anxiety and how can you change your thoughts cognitions that likely exacerbate anxiety behaviorally it may benefit you to create more structure and improve your organization and time management skills that might include the use of a planner a consistent sleep wakecycle exercise and movement and prioritizing activities of selfcare the second component take a little more selfreflection what are some of your thoughts that are problematic for example catastrophic thinking is common amongst people who struggle with anxiety those thoughts might sounds something like this is the worst day ever now perhaps it was the worst day ever but more than likely it wasnt more than likely it was a difficult day or a stressful day by correcting that thought from worst day to a tough day you bring the intensity of the anxiety down a notch making those kinds of corrections to your thinking throughout the day will help your anxiety feel less debilitating and more manageable,1,1,1047
427,i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,anxiety,social anxiety has skyrocketed since covid  plus could be trauma or ptsd  maybe you are a known person and feel safer not going so much out in public  i understand as a known person in my field depending on where i am it can be a bit much  or maybe the things you found joy in before are not as much of an interest  it could be your age or menapause hormones and injury  so many things could be in play depending on the client and their lifestyle  always best to get a check up  see if there is under lining medical issues and then go from there,1,1,545
431,"i just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home my family and i really need this job
   people keep telling me i have anxiety and im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road this is all new to me what can i do",anxiety,anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable the concern that i can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all  and that can become a problem indeed as opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you it could be helpful to start breaking it down what are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job is it being away from your family if so why once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller mouthfuls then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue,1,1,708
442,im socially awkward ive always want to be popular ive had the opportunity to be popular but every time i get it im too scared all i have to do is talk the popular people theyre really nice to me but im too scared of change i really want to work up the courage to lose my fear,anxiety,talking to people can be pretty scary  when we talk to people sometimes we overanalyze what we say or how we react in fear that we will seem weird or they wont like us which makes us appear awkward  so that overthinking piece can ironically work against uswhen you talk to them really spend time to listen to what they are saying  your default may be to think about how you will respond or whats cool to say but people like it best usually when you are genuine and yourself  if you focus on what you are paying attention to them then you will naturally have a response  if you can overthink about yourself you can definitely have some thoughts pop up when talking to other peoplealso keep in mind that if the conversations turn out to be less than youd hoped for thats ok  im assuming you are in high school but in any situation with peers if they dont like you then they arent worth all your worry and effort  give change a chanceyouve endured change in your life before this so let it happen again  you are in control hereyou get to choose who you talk to and dont talk to  that can be powerful,1,1,1096
444,i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,anxiety,i would first say that those are difficult thoughts and feelings that sound exhausting i cant image how this must feel but i can assure you that you are not alone these are common experiences in our society where we are made to feel as though we must go go go especially in the current world situation even simple things can feel overwhelming i believe that starting with baby steps such as taking even  minutes for yourself daily to be in the quiet and reflect can be helpful recognizing that even small selfcare steps such as drinking more water eating healthier foods or taking a hot bath can be helpful to relieve stress,1,1,624
447,i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me i really want to stop it and enjoy things,anxiety,thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people places and things to let us know more about ourselves we also have an inner voice dialogue conscience etc that helps us to determine the path for us often when someone is worried about the external feedback and focuses on this as the sole source of information it can create a dependency that can become problematic balance is key to so many things in life your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek dont discount it and rely only on the voices of others,1,1,642
448,i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,anxiety,does anyone notice that you get sick and cry on track meet dayshave you told anyonefrom what you write as much as you would like to please your school and dad something within you doesnt quite want to fully follow throughstep one in life always is to know what you want and what your limits are   it already is difficult to avoid listening to your bodytry understanding what is difficult in telling your father that youd like doing as he wishes only are not able to do so because you are emotionally and physically distraught on the days you have trackafter finishing the season for this year with your schools track team then expect to concentrate on taking care of your own need to not do trackhopefully your father will understand and care about your problem   if he does not and track is more important than your well being then you have a different problem entirely,1,1,870
450,im scared that my anxiety will make me say foul language i dont want to say those words though im only a teen and all my friends curse but i dont want to i dont know what to do,anxiety,its definitely possible that your response to anxiety is to swear though you dont have to feel controlled by that reaction  as a teen youre developing your identity based on what feels right to you and what doesnt  its ok to be different than your friends and just being around swearing doesnt mean you will for sure pick up that habit  what is it that connects your anxiety to swearing  if it feels like your automatic response might be to curse you could try picking some words that dont go against your values to use as a default when you are upset  you could also work directly with calming your anxiety maybe in ways that make you feel in control  breathing exercises as well as thought replacement replacing an unhelpful thought with a helpful one are good for that  whatever you try i wish you the best of luck,1,1,817
451,when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,anxiety,sure can  especially social anxiety or anxiety in the form of paranoia  are there any patterns to when or where this happens most  does it ever happen with people you feel safe and comfortable with  or only when you are in an uncomfortable social setting  if you notice any patterns you can focus in on the anxiety surrounding them and build coping skills to help you get through those moments if thats what would feel helpfulyou could also seek help and talk to someone about whats happening to get a better assessment of your situation and more personalized techniques  theres many counselors out there that are great at working with anxiety,1,1,643
454,its especially bad at night time i am scared of sleeping alone,anxiety,being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it is the first step to addressing and handling itgenerally anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life  somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very youngusually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonabletheir inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young hasnt faced the reality that the grown person is now capable even if this takes some practice try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown personalso sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely  this loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address,1,1,931
455,im a teenager i am almost always paranoid recently i started to think they watch i keep seeing in the corner of my eye someone moving the other night i heard breathing in my room and my eyes focused on a black shape i turned on the lights but no one was there,anxiety,sounds like anxiety and a strong imagination are getting the better of youdo you sometimes have less confidence in yourself than youd like to have  or doubt and question yourself in matters which in hindsight were easier to solve than you realized at firstthese are two examples of anxiety blurring your vision of a situation  possibly imagining sights and sounds is also blurring an accurate assessment of what actually takes place in your room at nightaddressing anxiety is best done indirectly not directlyconcentrate on knowing more of your reasons to question yourself so deeply in the first place  being a teenager certainly adds to overall anxiety  and you may have good reason from your growing up personal history to have more than an average amount of selfdoubtif you felt humiliated mocked ignored blamed any type of interaction with meaningful people in your life while you were younger then this probably set the groundwork to not have faith in yourselfawareness of where you feel vulnerable is the first step to deliberately changing this into a strength,1,1,1068
456,ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,anxiety,is there a certain problem you feel about living the way you describeas long as you feel satisfied with how your life is unfolding then youre making wise decisionsif you feel tension or that somehow doing as you describe is wrong then the first step is to identify the way you feel your methodology described above has a role in working against your best interestbasically define what is problematic in order to address it,1,1,422
460,i have these dreams of men and they always seem to try to hurt me its gotten so bad that i first wake at  then  and finally stay awake by  im always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake i hate falling asleep the longest ive went without sleep is three days,anxiety,that is awful i am sure you are ready to start getting some rest its normal for us to wake a few times in the night however when we are dealing with high anxiety or stress those times can turn into being up most night given that you are having these repeated dreams i am wondering what might be going on in your life either now  or in the past that could be triggering stress or maybe memories it can help to draw the dream out in the morning or even to look for metaphor in the long run seeking counseling can help you sort all that outin the meantime selfsoothing strategies may help you in the night when you wake and cant get back to sleep this can be anything with your sensesgetting a snack like tea and focusing on that taste smelling something pleasant listening to some relaxing music looking through a magazine taking a shower anything you can think of that might help you relax if it involves needing to get up thats okay getting out of bed can actually help you get out of that mind space and helps you associate your bed with relaxationsleep vs anxiety making it more likely you will fall asleep once  you lay down,1,1,1127
462,ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week i cant sleep i get a sense of doom and its hard to breathe i feel like nothing i do makes it better,anxiety,anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset attach themselvestry to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful peopleanxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long agoonce you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease  this is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others,1,1,649
463,i am a female and in my early teens i dont want to feel afraid of people when i meet someone i know that they are okay but i still feel afraid,anxiety,first off this is totally expected for someone your age  you are just moving into the phase of life where your job is to figure out your identity and who you are  its no surprise you are afraid of people if thats the way you feel you are strugglingif you are worried about people harming you that paints a different picture  do you struggle to trust your evaluations of others  what makes someone safe ish vs potentially dangerous  sitting down and coming up with some ways you have done this in the past or qualities of the people you trust now can help to disentangle what means safety and what means danger we can never truly know how someone will behave but if we always choose to never trust then we miss out on connection as well  your brain is still growing so the great news is its so flexible to change  it remains flexible for the entire lifespan but the teen years are really the last time its so moldable  if theres someone in your life you can trust reaching out for help can make how you are feeling less intense  its never fun to deal with everything by yourself  hope this helps,1,1,1094
465,when i get talked to by my dad or stepmom or if im in trouble i will begin to cry and not say whats wrong with me when my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong i never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me,anxiety,i really admire that you want to express yourself to your parents  its very normal to have fear about how to talk to a parent let alone two at the same time  most adults dont do what you want to docould you come up with what you want to say to them before you are feeling upset  what do you really need them to know  also do you want your dad and stepmom to meet certain emotional needs for you  maybe they would benefit from knowing that you have a hard time expressing yourself when you are upset and can help to come up with ways to help you through that   perhaps you need some space from them when you are crying or maybe you need to talk to one parent alone vs both at the same time you dont have to wait to be upset to have these conversations eitherif you feel you can approach them when things are calm whatever that means for your household it may be easier to communicateits important to know they may not respond the way you want  its up to you to decide if you feel safe or not to express yourself but it seems like you want to if you are seeking an answer for this dilemma,1,1,1086
467,a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,anxiety,why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who doesnt like large groupsthis is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you arepeople have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or smallif you arent afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups possibly you can generalize your findings to large group venuesif you try the and arent successful then likely you simply arent naturally someone who cares for large group settingsnot everything a person doesnt like is a symptom of something is wrong w the person,1,1,639
468,ive been on  mg of xanax twice a day for the past month it hasnt been helping me at all but when i take  mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to  mg twice a day without her thinking im abusing them i just have very big anxiety attacks should i stay on the mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,anxiety,do you think youre abusing xanaxit is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicteddrugs dont do anything helpful in solving lifes problems   once the effect wears off the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address itthink over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dosealso do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs    the more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place this consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you,1,1,668
470,i just about fall asleep then i cant help but sit up and walk around,anxiety,maybe you are afraid to let go of your problems for a few hoursalthough you didnt write this usually what keeps people awake or prevents them from falling asleep are worries about certain situations in their livesif this describes you then maybe talk with yourself to convince you that you are entitled to a good nights sleepreally we all are and feeling rested from the day and lifes tensions will better you to handle whatever the particular matters arealso maybe you will be more enthusiastic to go to bed if you have a comfy mattress and nice pillows  make your bed an inviting place because this will tempt you to enjoy relaxing enough to go to sleep,1,1,655
471,im just an extremely paranoid person i constantly feel as though i am in some sort of danger like as though i live in a horror movie with no resolution it worsens at night it gets to the point im scared in my own home more so than anything i have no access to the help i need so im desperate,anxiety,one approach is to be more accepting of yourself as someone who has fearsit is much easier to manage a problem when youre not fighting yourself for having a problemonce you are willing to accept this quality within yourself you may start to feel a little more relaxed about handling the fears when they ariseone answer is to examine the facts about the fears   ask yourself fact based questions as to how you would handle the worse case scenario of your fearsfeeling prepared whether or not the circumstance is highly unlikely to happen may increase your peace of mind with living the great fears within your mind,1,1,613
472,i dont know if im normal im really scared to touch a girl im a young adult and a virgin my fiancée and i want to have sex soon and this might mess everything up because she wants a baby soon as well,anxiety,only going off of the information in your question it seems like you maybe have some performance anxiety and fear disappointing your fiance  fear can be tricky in the sense that it quite often masquerades as something that seems under our control  for example your fear of touching a girl may actually be a fear of being incompetently intimate or a bad fianceits easier to deal with those fears by avoiding touch because that gives you control and how else would you deal with those fears i wonder if your fiance can be of any help to you  its scary to admit fears to people close to us but they can also offer some of the best support if thats been something youve experienced with her in the pastit sounds like you are really hard on yourself as well  its normal to have anxiety about your first time having sexthats a really special milestone  maybe its worth looking into performance anxiety tips  that can help you feel more prepared without removing the spontaneity of intimacyif it feels like nothing is working for you you could see a counselor or sex therapist to explore more of that fear  its nothing to be ashamed about because it does happen to both men and women,1,1,1176
474,i shake and have panic attacks,anxiety,one way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourselfthe insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic one way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life   when there are many activities or involvements to pay attention then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them  this may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed ina simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactionsto know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life,1,1,857
475,im a male in my early s lately my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot i then start to act weird because im trying to fight my paranoia this leads to people starring at me because they dont know that im suffering from panic attacks and paranoia they just notice me acting scared around kids and they think im a threat because of it    im not a pervert or predator i would never hurt a kid i like kids and dont know why im so scared to be around them    i dont understand why i feel like this am i a bad person how do i make this stop,anxiety,in our practice many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children  physically or sexually as you said these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts  not genuine desires to harm them this is a form of ocd we often call harm or pedophilic ocd what you are describing here as paranoia sounds similar to this and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good personif this is really what is going on further assessment by the right professional would determine this the current gold standard approach to addressing ocd is exposure with response prevention  in this case confronting the feared situations thoughts or images on purpose rather than avoiding them until they lose the fear and shame associated with them,1,1,856
477,i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,anxiety,maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware existssometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving waythis is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamicmost important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings including the ones which are uneasy such as killing to consider,1,1,570
479,im  and im sick and tired of going back and forth id like to stay at my mothers house this problem has really affected me ive had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and selfharm in the past    currently im going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available how do i handle this,anxiety,sounds like a lot is going on right now at such a young age id start with discussing with mom your concerns and ideal situation im unsure what prevents you from staying there but whoever you are staying with it should be brought to their attention in regards to your anxiety attacks deep breathing is always a benefits i have a link you can use to help to do this online if you are interested in addition finding ways you usually cope with anxiety and whats worked before can help and if it isnt exploring new way to calm you down can be beneficial this is something you can speak with your therapist about going forward when they are availablein regards to feeling suicidal i would call suicide prevention hotline you can google them if you truly feel the ideation is getting worse they are professional agents who can speak with you about your ideation and help you through the process hope this helps,1,1,903
484,i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,anxiety,tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring as well as listen to your specific worries and fearsinitiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sexthis way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion  not a prelude to sexif you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined,1,1,524
485,i panicked over a minor parking lot mistake it was totally my fault but due to another insurance issue i left a note with an illegible phone number guilty over this i got an envelope containing several hundred dollars unfortunately by the time i returned the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away since i cannot make this up to that individual how do i atone for my cowardly act i have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out,anxiety,from your writing you have already atoned for what you describe as cowardlyrecognizing your action and trying to directly correct it realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action are all examples of making things rightsince the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view,1,1,471
487,im a teenager and while ive never been to any kind of therapist i noticed i experience several anxiety symptoms i frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house i cant go into stores grocery stores specifically on my own and when i do i have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time i also forget things a lot,anxiety,despite your anxiety you are highly attuned to your sense of well being and skillful in articulating the details of when anxiety takes oversometimes people who anxious in specific realtime situations are helped by talking themselves through the anxietymaybe youd be able to distract yourself from the grocery store anxiety by telling yourself youre anxious and that youll be ok its only a grocery storethe longer term way to dissolve anxiety is through selfacceptance selflove selfbelief basically all the areas of trusting yourself to handle situationsanxiety is a fear of being overwhelmed by a circumstance or condition which ends badly for youoften the person can very well handle the situation about which theyre anxious   the problem is not trusting themselves enough to rely on their self knowledge,1,1,805
488,i feel too scared to meet people i dont know  even relatives i dont ever raise my hand or talk in school i feel like no one understands how can i handle this,anxiety,social anxiety is scary you dont feel safe in relationships and prefer to isolate yourself from the outside world is it something you can talk to your parents about a school counselor could help you the counselor could possibly order an evaluation to determine how to helpbuild your self confidence  start slow with your family and identify a subject you are familiar with and add to a general conversation its important to start finding things in common with others you dont need to carry the conversations just add a phrase or two have an exit strategy if you get too uncomfortable keep notes of what worked and what didnt work so youll be prepared for your next opportunity carpe diem,1,1,687
490,ive known him for about six years weve dated off and on i hadnt seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again i really want this to last this time i stayed the night do i text call or make contact first the same day of the morning i left his house,anxiety,it is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continueotherwise the answer to your question would appear naturally  if you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him then who texts whom first wouldnt really matter too muchtry to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone,1,1,446
492,example would be homecoming i was at my high schools home football game on friday and i left because i felt uncomfortable with all the people there and i just wanted to be by myself why is that,anxiety,hi im amelia oh that is so frustrating have you ever heard of social anxiety sounds like you may be suffering from it here is a link to a quiz httpswwwpsycomnetsocialanxietytestbesides being a therapist i am a mom to  kids a couple of my kids are very uncomfortable with crowds and become very anxious find yourself a therapist who can assess you and spend time with you to address these issues and to help you learn tools to help you navigate these emotionsi am wishing you the best,1,1,483
493,sometimes im fine and can go out or meet people but other days my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth ive always thought it was normal and i was just nervous but the other day it took me almost  minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter target by myself,anxiety,it is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder there isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen whats going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general anxiety itself is a really natural thing  its just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders it might be that for the most part the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms this twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way youd like,1,1,1093
499,my partner lives in canada while i live in the us we visit each other but we go months in between visits i have anxiety and im always anxious about him cheating or still having feelings for an ex that he dated for three years he doesnt understand my anxiety how do i stop myself from worrying so much,anxiety,would you worry less if you and your partner had a plan as to when you will be together as a couplelong distance relationships are not for everybody   some people need the daily or frequent interaction to feel securethe question is not so much how to deal with anxiety that your partner is cheating on you than whether your own emotional and relationship requirements are satisfied with a long distance relationshipanyway cheating has nothing to do with distance since married people cheat while living together for years under the same roof,1,1,541
500,i have severe anxiety and have tried everything everything makes it worstthe only thing that helps is my emotional support animal,anxiety,sorry to read of your sufferingis it actually permitted that people are able to take support animals to schooli see your point of the animal helping you  i just also see the point that some people have allergies to animal hair or dander or may feel distracted by an animal in the classroomyou may end up feeling worse if when you bring your support animal to school that it disturbs people or interferes with the routines of the classfor your anxiety i suggest some loving kindness toward yourself  be patient with yourself and that you have anxiety  if youre able to accept that some situations create great discomfort for you maybe youll tolerate these difficult situationembrace your anxiety as part of you basically rather than trying to banish it which because it actually is part of you is impossible to achievein a way im suggesting you become your own support animal  love yourself be kind to yourself and see if you feel a little less stressed in school,1,1,962
501,i have attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder posttraumatic stress disorder anxiety anger and memory problems i cant work i have no income im on medicine but i feel worthless i want to be normal,anxiety,i am so sorry to hear that you are struggling  it sounds like youve had a traumatic experience that has impacted your life in many ways  without knowing much about your history i wonder if the trauma you suffered has lead to the anxiety anger and memory problems you are dealing with in addition to ptsd  i would encourage you to look for a trauma therapist who offers a sliding scale or pro bono services  there may also be community mental health services in your area that offer free therapy if you are eligible for grant,1,1,524
502,i never feel like myself i cant even think straight anymore i start stuttering and i cant remember anything i always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with what feels like someone else i dont know why i feel this way but i hate it,anxiety,hi houston okay somethings definitely going on right my gut is to start with your family physician because you have some physical symptoms while it seems anxiety is a likely problem here your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy without knowing more thats all i can say at this point best of luck,1,1,370
505,i had to put a restraining order against my exfiancé he was served last night he was mentally and verbally abusive towards me i thought it was my nerves but every time i stand up i get sick if i sit and rock im fine,anxiety,hello and thank you for your question you may be right your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety that is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock that is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress if you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms you may want to visit your primary care provider they may tell you that they dont see anything physically wrong with you and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience a visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way i work as a counselor in primary care and i promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common sometimes with counseling those physical symptoms actually stop be well and i hope you feel better soonrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc,1,1,1083
506,ive been dealing with this for years my mom thinks im overly emotional and refuses to offer any help like therapy or seeing a doctor shes seen me when im having a panic attack and just said i was faking for attention or that im a hypochondriac i just want to get better,anxiety,how old are youare you old enough in your state to have therapy without your mothers consentyour moms attitude toward you may be one significant reason on why you feels so much tension in the first placedont let her opinions and beliefs get in the way of what you know about yourselfare you in school and does that school have a guidance counselorwould you talk with that person about your difficult getting your mom to retain helping services for youkeep looking for local resources which will support you either directly or indirectly by advocating for your right to receive mental health care,1,1,595
507,i am so terrified of having sex anymore because i have been told over and over that sex is dangerous even though me and my partner used both forms of protection my partner is not happy about this and simply wants more sex and honestly i want to give that to her,anxiety,i would suggest possibly talking with a physician about all the different types of protection they may be able to help you to know about all of the options that are availableit sounds like your partner is open to understanding your concerns perhaps until you have the chance to speak with someone about the effectiveness of different contraception and forms of protection are either of you open to other forms of engaging in sexual intimacy without penetration but with use of vibrators toys designed for sexual interactions etc,1,1,528
510,i feel really uncomfortable when i have peoples attention it makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class can i get over this social anxiety,anxiety,since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result or fear of being judged negatively as though having failed some sort of test consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audiencemaybe for example if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would youd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audienceonce you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort it may feel more manageableyes social anxiety can change  you may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audienceand it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you,1,1,666
511,my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,anxiety,have you spoken to him about your fears perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure  also it is important to trust your intuition  perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned it may not be paranoia  it may be based in reality,1,1,286
513,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks  chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were  see the illustration belowthis is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior panic attack allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations prompting events and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur consequences  finally  it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities such as not enough sleep poor nutrition trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred  working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as dbt or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events,1,1,1200
516,i started dating my fiancé two years ago my first cousin is married to my fiancés sister there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife my uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin and it upsets my mom,anxiety,based on the information provided this is an issue with boundaries   sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you  i do not like to assume so i will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation  enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships  triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other  from someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure  you may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries  although it is possible it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time  hope this help,1,1,887
518,whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,anxiety,as you do it more it should get better or at less with less anxiety  anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public  i hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years  i even experienced that when i first became a counselor and had to lead classes  i asked myself why were i so anxious  i admit at that time i didnt have confidence in myself  the more i prepared and practiced the more my confidence level increased  yours will too,1,1,465
519,i am a teenage girl ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since i was very young the problem is that i dont remember anything about this dream i still know that its the same one and then i wake up in a panic and i cry really loud without knowing the reason why do i see the same dream why can i not remember it and what should i do to remember it,anxiety,there is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that i know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves one thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up people seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember,1,1,1148
520,ive been with my boyfriend for a year and a half he loves me a lot and i love him it hurts to be apart from him for so long it hurts all over and then i feel like it wont last,anxiety,i would suggest that you look up the word codependency and its characteristics  see if you relate to those characteristics  i have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly  for some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss  considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues,1,1,401
521,i started seeing this guy that i met at a mutual friends place he recently broke up with his exgirlfriend and started seeing me everything was great in the beginning then i started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his exgirlfriend again its all i think about i am still seeing him but things have changed because i am at a loss for words i get stuck in my own thoughts i like and care for him a lot he just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies,anxiety,sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts  as you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  what is contributing to these negative thoughts  his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question,1,1,296
522,i have not had a friend since i was  i dont go anywhere and i have no job all because im afraid of people,anxiety,individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want in group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another,1,1,625
523,i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,anxiety,i think you have identified something important here its not unusual to experience feelings that dont seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes in this case it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you annoying and bothersome despite knowing that people like you it seems that theres still a part of you that feels like youre a botherfinding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need,1,1,492
525,im a little paranoid my mind does get the best of me one night i put chairs under all of my door knobs because i thought someone might break in i also think a lot which is probably the reason for the paranoia i cant stand loud noises like the sound of cars going by the grocery store is too noisy and i feel like people are looking at me,anxiety,paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid  they believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threatsfrom what you write you are aware that your actions may be understood as extremeinstead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category try seeing each of the behaviors you list here as your own uniquenessthis way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendenciesif you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid it is simply the way of who you areone possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself  they may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream  from what you describe you already are dealing with what you call paranoia,1,1,823
526,when i go to school i feel like everyone is judging me even my friends i get overwhelmed which these thoughts and sometimes cannot get out of what i call a deep hole of thoughts i barely go to any of our school dances because of all of the people not even when i am completely alone do these thoughts go away i still feel like people can see me and are judging me,anxiety,it sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged even when alone it sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like such as leading them to isolate in therapy you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationships,1,1,773
527,i met a guy a while ago and i cant stop thinking about him i feel like i love him but i dont think i know him what if he is not who i think he is i cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend i dont know am i too obsessive every time we talk though its like magic he makes me feel amazing but what if im mistaken,anxiety,keller it sounds like youre living this relationship in your mind instead of in the real world you can get answers to your questions by talking to himgetting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have youre asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship so what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him fear of rejection fear of something else if you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships i recommend a therapist to help you work through that i wish you well ,1,1,556
528,ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,anxiety,hi new jerseyyou talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosisanxiety and the moving in together thats a loti love how you recognise that you been questioning everything i think anxietys got its toe in the door and its pushing you around wanting some power over you fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that its best to either pull away or fight but letting anxiety control how you see your relationship isnt the answer here i think you know that alreadyyou must have moved in with him for a reason and its appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriendwhen youre in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change i suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear,1,1,1110
529,my toddler defies everything i say and doesnt see me as authoritative so she says no about everything id like to hear some ways i can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time,anxiety,thats a good question i would say learn to pick your battles what types of behaviorsituations can you let go of if you allow yourself to worry about the various areas in life that you cannot control you will find yourself stressed out and unable to manage everything know that toddlerhood comes with lots of nos tantrums noncompliance and a growing need for independence when your toddler does something that you dont approve of remain calm explain to himher the appropriate way to act and model it for himher remember to give your toddler praise when heshe does something good or acceptable be consistent and follow through with your instructions finally know that you are not alone parenting comes with its set of challenges but all you can do is your very best good luck to you,1,1,780
531,i was violently raped by another women who was my friend of  years im having bad flashbacks im scared to sleep because i see it in my dreams i dont leave the house because i have panic attacks,anxiety,im sorry for your sufferingthere are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frighteningonce you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program youll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular lifethen you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friendsending good wishes in your work,1,1,477
532,"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal
   most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes",anxiety,it is very hard to want a loving relationship and either see or imagine all around you the great times other couples are having extra hard is that other peoples comments may start giving you the sense that you are letting them down to not have a relationshipall the fantasies that develop from viewing facebook photos and imagining everyone or most people in ideal relationships just augments any frustration of not being part of this groupyour post sounds like youre being true to yourself and honoring who you are really by developing clear standards of what youd expect from a relationshipfor the longterm whatever develops in your relationship life you will always be able to look back and know you had selfintegrity by being your natural self youre being attractive   probably very unlikely that a young woman who would like a relationship will never have onemaybe the young men in your school are not yet emotionally mature enough to know how to see and appreciate youeven though it may be hard have patience with bringing in someone who is good for you  and continue your keen insight of yourself because it is guiding you to be the best in all areas of livingsending good luck in all areas,1,1,1197
534,for my whole life ive been very unconfident insecure and selfquestioning im super quiet because im scared of what people will think of me i avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety it is how both of my parents have always been and i feel like im doomed to that life also it makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because im too nice it causes me depression and brings me down im in my early twenties and i really need to create a better life for myself ive been like this for so long so how do i change,anxiety,one of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves  despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries  once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries  in effect assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem you may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation   one of the workbooks that i have found to be very helpful is the assertiveness workbook how to express your ideas and stand up for yourself at work and in relationships by randy j paterson,1,1,894
535,i have a lot of issues going on right now first of all i have a lot of trouble sleeping at times while other nights i sleep too much and still feel quite tired im also noticing increased irritability and experiencing anxiety attacks that last for hours is there something wrong with me and if so what should i do,anxiety,it sounds like you are noticing yourself becoming overwhelmed with anxiety feeling more irritable and struggling to sleep consistently there are many possibilities in regards to what may be contributing to these things you are noticing and a competent therapist may be able to help in therapy you may be able to gain insight into these experiences as well as develop strategies for coping with and eventually alleviating anxiety irritability and inconsistent sleep,1,1,464
536,i feel that i need to end my present relationship he lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month i want someone who is more present and more of a life companion lately he has had a very busy work schedule and i have only seen him a few times in the last  weeks i told him that i cant continue in this way because i constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority i also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship i want we have been together  years the problem is that i panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking i will never meet someone i like we have gone through this cycle already  times and i feel it is unhealthy to stay in it but my aversion to the anxiety and depression i experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile,anxiety,it sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck it also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner are pretty overwhelming a competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you,1,1,466
538,im a teenager and i struggle with going out and talking to people i feel awful about leaving home i know i cant afford a therapist so i dont know what my problem is but i think i might have social anxiety,anxiety,if you are noticing that anxiety tends to be triggered around interactions with others then you may have social anxiety working with a therapist you may be able to gain insight into the nature of the anxiety develop tools for coping with it and take steps that may alleviate it over time so that you can enjoy your interactions with others if you are short on money there still may be options for you to be able to see a therapist check with your insurance provider about your behavioral health coverage if you have medicaidapple care there are some private practice therapists who accept this form of insurance as well as community clinics which do if you are not insured some therapists and clinics will work on a sliding fee scale and accept either low fee or may even work with you probono for free,1,1,802
539,whenever i dont tell my friends or anyone what i did or stuff thats not really important i feel terrible like theres a hole in my stomach it only goes away when i hurt myself,anxiety,hi kansas i feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here feelings are never wrong but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope selfharm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach although im glad you said something here a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively i hope you reach out to someone soon,1,1,535
541,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxiety,while anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come this is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially this fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again however as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online,1,1,882
544,i find myself being very outgoing most of the time but there are some times when i dont know what to say i dont even want to talk at all its like i search for the right thing to say and nothing ever comes out i dont know if im outgoing only to fill the void of not knowing what to say i dont know if people like that about me im very selfconscious and always think people are talking about me so it makes me have a cold shoulder and not want to talk,anxiety,would you feel more secure in conversations if instead of talking soon after meeting someone or entering a social situation you simply listened attentively to the other peoplethis way youd have a more secure idea of what topics the group likes talking about and whether you like talking about these topics as wellmaybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focusstart by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you aremaybe you simply need new and different groups,1,1,552
545,this is preventing me from getting a job i have bad relationship with my bipolar mother i am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that i have locked myself in my room i have no friends or other family to help me i have no money for therapy but i think i need therapy before i can secure a job,anxiety,overwhelming fear social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge  but there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this  so there is hope   in addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor who may prescribe a medication to help you relax there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid  a good cbt therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts  behavior is also important  despite how you may feel it is helpful to go out to do things that relax you maybe a yoga class or a meditation class  exercise diet eat well think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past and force yourself to do these things again  i know that this seems hard but it beats the alternative doesnt it  of course i recommend you pick up a copy of my book living yes which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out  i hope you get unstuck soon  mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg,1,1,1099
546,my dad refuses to acknowledge my anxieties about going to parties dinners etc whenever i have an opinion it gets shut down my mom and everyone else behaves likewise for my father who heads a company this is normal he has to be right all the time he blatantly refuses to even try to see it from my angle    recently however its been getting to the point where i feel pressured and unable to speak my mind it isnt possible for me to get professional oneonone help he tells me to grow a pair and get over it i recently have been developing more severe body image and selfconfidence issues which i have had all my life i feel invalidated by my dad i have been more paranoid lately as well i cant turn on location services anymore on my phone because of a past incident he makes me feel guilty about it i feel rather worthless more often than not unfortunately what do i do,anxiety,im sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents it sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment i would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that heshe may help mediate the conversation with themif you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enoughgood luck,1,1,780
547,whenever i leave my girlfriend i get panic attacks im taking medications to control them but im thinking of moving in with her since i get so anxious,anxiety,im sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks i hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief unfortunately i dont feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety although you may feel very anxious about leaving her your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner you may be able to render this particular situation but its likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises therefore it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the futuretalk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga a trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurringi wish you the best of luck it sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and i hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another,1,1,1169
548,when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a  but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,parenting,watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult on a very basic level there exists a primal need to protect them from harm the hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older at some point there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts children no longer need the basics food shelter water safety as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes this is where the ability to communicate with them letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move is so important keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it,1,1,745
584,my exwife married and used me to have a child she now uses that child as a pawn i know my child misses me but i need to move on and not live in the past how do i do this do i see my child as much as possible or very little is it more confusing for the child,parenting,as you will see in the two verses i will list below jesus and the apostle paul are telling us that we have to learn how to let go of our past jesus says that anyone who is trying to move forward in his walk and call for god  but keeps looking back  is not fit for the kingdom of god  seek deliverance from parts of your past youre struggling to let go ask the holy spirit or your higher power to help  find how to incorporate visitation so this child see you and also maybe seek some legal advice on this matter,1,1,511
589,i was a single mom most of their growing up life and have guilt about trying to work three jobs and being gone a lot my children are successful with their own businesss have lots of nanny and cleaning help but i just feel they have such a great opportunity to spend it with their kids,parenting,you seem to have been a very positive influence in your kids livesthey may have worked so hard because they understood how difficult and tiring your life was as a single momi feel you are seeing your kids lives through the measurement of how much toil was in your life as a single momin other words what you see your kids overlooking or not appreciating may remind you of your wishes during the many years you raised your kidsif it helps you and is possible then maybe you could spend more of your own time tougher with your grandkids  this may give some reward for the many years you spent working to support your kids and had no choice in the amount of time you had with your kidsas far as your kids relationship to their kids it is now their turn to raise them as they wish within ethical boundaries of coursedepending on the topics you and your kids talk about consider to bring up your concern as to whether they feel their kids your grandkids are missing anything due to the limited time they have with the parents,1,1,1020
590,my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless he calls me names and makes me feel depressed i want to move out because i swear if i stay here im going to lose it what can i do,parenting,you are valid  your idea about i want to move out may be the key to putting some distance between you two and giving you the space you deserve also taking the power away from him and giving it back to yourself  do not base your worth on others opinions often how other people act towards us is more about them than us  other peoples opinion of you does not decide the sum total of your worth you alone do thatthis meditation could prove helpful   i am enough  guided meditation,1,1,477
592,he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids my fiancé tells me it makes her angry and doesnt like it but she seems afraid to say anything to him about it for some reason is it okay for him to do this,parenting,the short answer to your question is no its not okay for anyone to ever be doing this theres a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention nevertheless dont hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call     ideally your fiancé would be able to speak directly to her exhusband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements the fact that shes afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior and that she hasnt been able to give you any reason for her fear suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors entitlement andor codependence   i hope things work out well for all and im confident a skilled therapist could help all navigate how best to set boundaries and experience greater healing,1,1,828
596,"there is just no communication at all between us she sleeps constantly all day not at night she acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time the only time she comes out is to eat    she has aches and fatigue weight gain hair loss and skin problems she does not look after her health
   i dont know how to communicate with her she is not open to any suggestions how do i get through to her",parenting,not much to go on  her age medical etc  this can be frustrating seeing a loved one sick  find what interests her or has an influence over her  if you know whymaybe try and allow her to heal  presents things in front of her that give her no choice but to focus on instead of what has put her in this state  what brings her joy good luck,1,1,335
601,is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,parenting,i recommend asking your son about the reasons he chooses to play alone at recess if he is happy on his own and you know he has some friends i would not be very concerned however there may be bullying going on at school in the case of bullying it may be a situation where you as his parent will need to step in,1,1,309
604,i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,parenting,children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with childreni would also wonder where she is getting this idea sometimes children hear things on tv or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are rememberingit may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking forim curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry does she say the same sorts of things about youit may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well,1,1,989
607,my dad is always and i mean always cussing and screaming at me for no reason at all he makes me feel stupid he also compares me to my other siblings in a negative way and demeans me is this abuse,parenting,im really sorry to hear that you are going through thisits a little difficult to answer your question because the laws that define child abuse are different from state to state but usually things like what you describe your dad is doing are not considered to be child abusethe more important thing is how you feel about what is going on it sounds like this is really bothering youif you dont think you can talk to your dad about how you feel you might want to try talking to another adult you trust like a family member or teacher they may be able to help you figure out some ways to communicate with your dadi think you might feel better if you can talk to someone about how your are feeling,1,1,692
612,he is an adolescent he has peed his pant multiple times over the last few years all at times when he is too wrapped up in a video game or video we have taken away games and videos for long periods of time as punishment but after a few months of having then back he pees his pants again,parenting,sounds as though your son is pissed off about somethingpunishment will most likely result in more of the same not less of the peeing you would like to stop from happeninglaziness is more of a social judgement than it is a characteristic of its own meritis this your description of your son or his description of himselffirst step always before addressing any of the family dynamics emotions and psychology of the people involved is a medical rule out as to why your son pees at times he plays video gamesif he has medical clearance that there is no physiological  problem then talk with your son on his opinions as to why he pees if he is aware of the urge to pee and ignores it or that his attention gets so absorbed he doesnt notice the urge to peesee what modifications you can create by cooperating with your sonmaybe it is as simple as each two hours he sets a timer and when it goes off he takes a bathroom break,1,1,918
614,"i am in my early s and i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live alone
   my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do",parenting,these things happen and it is her roof if you can try and stay busy avoid situations that make you feel like this  be kind and courteous as if you were living with a room mate  you can also pay some kind of rent   dont feel bad even adults face this with their parents even when their  and you are    some children take care of their older parents or deal with family responsibilities  try and do what you can to move forward in your life or ask her to help so that you can live on your own and maybe she just needs to feel needed,1,1,530
619,"im being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child i feel like im trapped and i have no escape i feel like i have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it
   i need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since i have nowhere else to go i feel very emotionally drained how can i deal with this",parenting,i cant imagine what you are feeling but i can tell you that you are right to be concerned about your children baring witness to this abuse  this is a great teachable moment for your kids  how you handle yourself will be very important for your children to see  your reaction is what you should focus on  will you react with rage and name calling will you listen to your parents with respect and talk to them in private about how they are speaking to you in front of your kids  will you talk your kids about what is going from reading this i am assuming you live with your parents  if this is the case you have to think about what you can do to change your situation  have a plan set a goal  dont lose hope,1,1,705
629,can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor every detail about what happened during the other parents visitation in order to help build a case for child custody,parenting,"i see a few issues herefirst the age of the child is important  if the child is considered an
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age  and age  no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions 
if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law",1,1,1129
630,i have four children one of them is in her s and she cannot afford to go nor can i pay for her she went last year for two weeks by herself,parenting,i imagine you are trying to figure out a way to be fair to your adult kids  the key word is adult  if your daughter can afford to join the family for a vacation thats great shes welcome to come  however as you pointed out she took a vacation by herself last year  she chose to put her resources time off work and money into doing that  good for her  she did what she wanted  if she wants to budget time and money for a family vacation she willas for feeling guilty let me echo the sentiments already offered  vacations are lovely but not a survival need  your girl is in her s and its her turn to provide for herself  you did your parenting  now go enjoy your vacation with whoever can and wants to join you,1,1,707
632,when they come home from their dads and i fuss at them for anything they move like they are dodging being hit they say theyre sorry over and over really fast i ask and they say no one has hit them and ive seen no marks am i being paranoid or am i right to be,parenting,this sounds frightening and overwhelming and im glad you are reaching out for help i cant say for sure your children are being abused but i can understand your  suspicion since there appears to be a change your childrens behavior i think it would be important for you to keep an eye on the situation incase you notice any other changes if you become more concerned even  suspicions of child abuse are reportable to  family protective services if they feel it is necessary they can do an  investigation you are doing the biggest thing for your children by being there for them and supporting them,1,1,595
635,my daughter is in later elementary school she cant color in the lines her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines,parenting,at times when a child is not displaying milestone behavior at the same rate that is average for their peers this should raise concern so you are correct in reaching out for advice speaking with your childs pediatrician as well as school staff may be the first places to start you can request that she receive an assessment and evaluation with a subsequent treatment plan to meet any needs she may have,1,1,401
642,my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of  she then started to act younger than she is    now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,parenting,this is certainly an important issue to look into it is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs developmental history also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family  andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point,1,1,485
644,i am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism we try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else the day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen so we just talk in a calm voice however other kids see the treatment as unfair,parenting,behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family membersit is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not to expect both sides to get along harmoniouslyin order to achieve this the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autismthis would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isnt part of summer camp for childrenwhat you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administratorsultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates,1,1,955
645,when my son was a teenager we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude a week after he graduated his dad made him leave because of the same issues all four parents tried to talk to him and he just refuses help all around he is now living with his grandparents he had a job and took steps to get his license and an insured vehicle i thought he was heading down the right road and then he tells me he quit his job because he didnt like it i just dont know what to do,parenting,probably the best way to be supportive of your son is to tell him what bothers you about the way hes handling himselfif youd like him to work with your suggestions then before you make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talentspeople are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of themoffer your availability to talk with him if you genuinely feel available to speak with him in a nonjudgmental way,1,1,536
646,she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,parenting,you felt bad when you lied so you told the truth  i imagine your mom was really shocked and upset  both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person  its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child from whom she always assumed honesty was capable of being dishonest  thats not awesome but its not the end of the world  you made a mistake  youll make more of those in your life just try not to make the same ones over and over againit sounds like you and your mom are close so i can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you  since you are a fundamentally honest person the way back to being trusted is going to be simple but may take a little time  the recipe is easy  say what you are doinggoing to do do only that unless change is necessary in which case you inform others involved and repeat  and cut yourself some slack  your mom will recover and so will you  its an important and painful lesson about integrity but once learned it will serve you well,1,1,1023
649,im concerned about my  year old daughter    about a month or two ago she started walking on her toes as well as coloring and writing very messy this all happened very suddenly she has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly    is this something i should be concerned abou any advice will help,parenting,it is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter i cant offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think abouthas something else happen recently that has been stressful upsettingis your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that behave you discussed these recent changes with her without being too serious or accusatorythere is so much changing for her and you nowcommunication and connection are crucial i hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes,1,1,572
651,i have three children the oldest is nine and not my biological child the middle child is three and the youngest is one i have a great relationship with the oldest two children but i havent developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child i rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times is this normal,parenting,this is your experience your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal which means is this common or the rule this question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis turbed etymology agitated or stirred up  feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right  so though  it might be normal common the rule  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old the dis turbance or stirring up in you is important and requires your attention your listening if you will to your higher self,1,1,582
654,shes in her early s and she has a toddler,parenting,well first lets identify what factors are involved in the situation about which you wroteare you the only decision maker regarding your stepdaughter living with youis her dad and your partner living under the same roofwould you feel any obligation to consult with your husband about his opinion and his way of handling the situationhave you talked with your stepdaughter about your observation and your reaction to the fact of her not honoring your boundariesconsider too that there will be an effect on the toddler your grandchild if you kick out your daughteris your daughter financially ready to live on her own and support herself and her childyou certainly have the right to define the terms of what goes on under your roofit is only fair to everyone that as many variables as possible be consideredthe conclusion may be that it is in everyones best interest for your stepdaughter to move outif everyone feels respected and a well thought out plan is developed then the least amount of hurt and stress and the most amount of happiness will be possible from this change,1,1,1073
657,my step nephew a preteen has begun masturbating i also had to take away the internet because he was caught looking up porn im worried about him,parenting,your nephews behavior sounds normal and developmentally appropriate  masturbation is a healthy expression of sexuality  most families to create some rules about where its ok to masturbate for example stating that it should be done in the privacy of the childs own room  im wondering if you or another adult in his life have talked to him about his developing sexuality  it seems like that would help him and you handle his increasing maturity,1,1,442
658,we have tried gentle talking counting to calm her and talking about it sending her to her room and then trying to talk when shes calmer and now calisthenics however nothing is working,parenting,theres two things this post relays  one which im sure youve already looked into  is working with the school to address this problem sure sometimes kids dont get along but most schools look at bullying seriously and this sounds serious the other though is additional tools to consider to help your daughter if you havent already read greenes explosive child you might give it a shot while its a little preachy many of the tools are wonderful and can help parents navigate tantrums httpswwwamazoncomexplosivechildunderstandingfrustratedchronicallydp another tool that can redirect a child thats losing it is a task if her tantrums say involve throwing things maybe shes in charge of throwing all the sticks and acorns off the driveway into the garbage bin ie hey jenny you seem really angry right now lets use all that energy and get some work done go with her throw with her even  if possible  making a game out of getting the acorns into the bin from a distance i wish you all the best,1,1,985
659,i am in my s with  kids and no job and im behind on the bills ive been trying everything with no results i feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine i give intil it hurts and im afraid that im going to fail my babies    ive been struggling for  yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time how can i get some support,parenting,financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life projectif your partner doesnt work or doesnt contribute his money to the household bills then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the governmentespecially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you  sometimes too a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kidsim glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids  this is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place,1,1,648
661,"my daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparents house she wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself
    we also have a new baby in the house i didnt know if this would contribute to this how should i approach this",parenting,you wrote a very full family context w many directions to examinedo you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episodeis it possible the grandma abuses your daughter or tells her scary stories watches scary movies  these are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughteralso ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what killing herself means   seven year olds dont have a concept of death being a forever condition  seven year olds dont have a sense of future meaning besides likingdisliking them   maybe the new baby is a factor  do you feel this is a factor   trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new babyeven if she is i doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action including suicide,1,1,890
662,the birth mother attempted suicide several times while pregnant the adopted mother was terminally ill upon adopting the baby and died when the child was just over one year old the adopted father then remarried to a physically psychologically and emotionally abusive woman the child was placed in foster care at  years old    what might be the long term effects on an adult with this childhood history,parenting,the true answer is no one can really say with certaintythe variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  all anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guessthe only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go throughsome people become great teachers therapists and philosophers who have this background  some give up on life and hide away from othersthe best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth,1,1,670
663,my grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment,parenting,parents are to teach discipline to children not punishment   punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt  there is a different in discipline and punishment  punishment could have long term affects on a childs self image and growth  it can lead to others issues such as bullying from peers as well  whatever your grandson has done there is a much better way of getting him to understand that his actions are not acceptable  punishment is not one them  encourage the stepmother to build a positive relationship with him this way he will learn to respect and trust her  his actions would improve  she may need to attend a parenting class for blended families,1,1,664
665,i want to live with my mom my dad gets angry and makes me feel like everything is my fault i still talk to my mom although my dad tells me that im no allowed to im scared i will make the wrong decision and that my dad will hate me    how do i tell him that i want to live with my mom,parenting,yes from what you wrote your dad doesnt accept responsibility for the way he feels and blames you for his feelingsim glad you recognize hes handling himself less as a grown person and more like a young childi also understand your hurt and frustration that your father handles himself in a way which shows for now that he is unwilling to respect your wishesyour decision is not surprising since most people wouldnt want to live with a parent who shows little interest to respect their kids decisionsin terms of how to tell him your choice do this in simple and most basic information terms   ive decided for now to live w momi suggest to not offer reasons to him bc he doesnt seem interested in hearing them   giving him reasons would likely trigger him to rebut themif he asks questions answer them as simply as possibleif and when you feel he is more willing to understand and know you then youd feel more free to have genuine dialogue with himright now he doesnt seem very ready to handle this,1,1,995
667,i have three children a biological daughter a stepdaughter and a stepson i found out my stepdaughter overdosed today my daughter blames me i told her to stay out of it im scared of all three kids now they all blame me for their choices they made all three have drug addictions i had a stroke in  so i need to depend on people from now on,parenting,blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms  it is not just for addiction and often we blame the ones closest to us  you can not stop them from blaming you you can stop yourself for taking on the burden  we are all in charge of the choices we make  no one makes us do something other than our self  we choose how we internalize and react to situations  i would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward,1,1,513
668,"she refuses to talk to me and told my mom her grand mother that she is remembering things from the past i dont know what to do my daughter blames me and swears she hates me
   my parents say i should just let my daughter live with her dad but i dont see how i could fix things if i only see her every other weekend what should i do",parenting,sorry to hear about your high degree of stresshow old is your daughterwho abused yours daughterthe answers make a difference to your decisionobviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with youif someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one anotherwhat does your daughter tell you she wantsher wishes must be considered toorelationships can be fixed   sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other,1,1,758
669,shes a teenager and for the last two years shes lived with her older brother shes angry because she wants to come live with me but my current living situation is not the best for her she refuses to see any reason shes being disrespectful her sexual curiosity is waking up,parenting,youre her mom and she needs you  i would suggest focusing on connection  since you are not currently living together one way to do this would be to plan a date in which she gets to decide what you do together  give her time to think about what she wants to do  as long as the activity is safe and affordable try to do it even if its not your thing  while you are with her turn off the phone and give her your undivided attention  the goal would be just for you to enjoy each other and connect,1,1,492
670,my husbands exwife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor he by his own admission is addicted to child pornography my stepdaughters are now all teenagers they do not know my husbands exwife has kept this information from my stepdaughters the stepfather has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently the exwife minimizes it by saying that he has repented it is a constant strain on my husband knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography my own therapist believes the girls should be told the exwife says her therapist says the opposite,parenting,the information from the other therapists here is sound and prudent there are what sounds to be real legal is this man a rso registered sex offender is he prohibited from being in proximity to minors usepossession of child porn violates any  of state and federal statues and safety issues at play here your husbands daughters have an immediate need to know and this can be done developmentallycontextual factually and in a nonshaming fashion i would further counsel that you and your husband his daughters welfare is at stake seek immediate legal counsel the exwife here seems to be between a rock and a hard place of her own creation  she desperately needs care treatment for herself resources for your consideration  httpwwwmissingkidscomhome  httpswwwjusticegovcriminalceoscitizensguideusfederallawchildpornography,1,1,817
672,her father and i have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now she is an adolescent and the problem is mostly food she is now overweight and we just dont know what to do anymore she can be disrespectful and doesnt listen to or respect what we say,parenting,i would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury the fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning i would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment they may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue,1,1,796
673,me and my adult daughter just do not get along shes very belittling to me when i dont agree with her its almost like she scolds me we get into all out war shes said i dont support her in what she does and that ive never loved her she calls me horrible names and she pushes my buttons to the point i call her names,parenting,as frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feelsto some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the otherdeveloping ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lotone major point to be aware is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic because it is strong may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adultswatch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority instead of considering her as a grown personthe same is true of your daughter  she may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she isher needs from you are real they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way,1,1,797
674,i am divorced and happily remarried our blended family of children are in their s my youngest age  continues to call me crazy and favors her dad he was abusive to me and i left with injuries he never wanted kids and i did he paid child support only through forced wage earners now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past  years as a single mom i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core im not sure how to handle this,parenting,hi i understand what youre going through your daughters favor him because he has done no wrong in their eyes im guessing they lived with you growing up i was the same way i favoured my dad thinking he has done no wrong he also abused my mother multiple times and that never came to mind kids like their other parent more mainly because they dont see them everyday and they usually buy them everything they want because all he does it pay child support by force and then spoil their kids to make them happy you seem like a great mom dont doubt yourself,1,1,551
676,my brother just broke up with his girlfriend while they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us how should we approach the situation is she doing the right thing for her child,parenting,hi tampa i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact in my book the more people loving a child the better but ultimately she has the right to make these decisions to oppose her wont likely do any good you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well,1,1,626
677,my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,parenting,has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitationor is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughterif no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up no one has even asked where she is why she isnt present then i dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter than the father is willing to make for seeing herif your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or notthe one move id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated,1,1,866
679,my fiancé and i have been in a relationship for two years we have an infant son my fiancé also has a child from a previous relationship we do not live together i live with my mother currently while i get on my feet and hes living with some friends my mother and i have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time we cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house she has made it clear that she wants me gone recently i was talking to my father who lives in a different state my father and i have always had a good relationship i explained to him the situation i am in with my mother and he said he would like for me my fiancé and our son to come live with him and his wife i would really love to go i do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer there is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state the problem is my fiancé is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child he and his childs mother have a horrible relationship and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away i believe i would be doing what is best for my child by moving away but i do not want to leave without my fiancé i have already explained the situation to him and he will not give in do i continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together do i move away with my child and have my relationship end i do not want to take him out of either of his kids lives what do i do,parenting,hi bethlehemyou have a big decision to make  i appreciate your fiancés need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe placeim a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together i get that you want your dad to take care of all of you but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent i say that without knowing how old you are but if you have a child and a two year relationship you basically have declared your independence anyway  i wish you the best,1,1,647
680,just wondering if this is a deviant act and if i should be concerned for him he isnt quite ,parenting,well its certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so i would wonder if this child is trying to say somethingi think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on if there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly,1,1,435
681,my exhusband told my two adolescents that santa doesnt exist on the day before christmas they are desperate to hold on to the magic of christmas but i dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that santa is real i dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories but i also dont want to lose their trust,parenting,well boise the cats out of the bag now isnt it i love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of christmas they must want that too if they still believe in santa into their teen years which is unusual i believe i wonder if they had already figured it out anywaybut they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best so its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and christmas can still be magical in so many ways really who says they have to stop believing in santa santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and love,1,1,599
682,my toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training he almost throws up every time he sees his poop he gags and will not go on the toilet we have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it when he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee he holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper i dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him how can i help him get over this fear and passed the stress,parenting,your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained you dont say how old he is so im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so i suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again in general teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively,1,1,579
683,"im a senior high school student im also five months pregnant i got pregnant by my boyfriend of three years my parents dont want us to communicate with each other he cant even come to visit my gynecologist my mom goes to attend all of my doctors appointments shes supportive of me i wish though that my boyfriend was next to me and be able to see his daughter on a sonogram at the very least my family does not understand that he deserves that much i cry all the time because i feel lost and hopeless
 i need guidance and i believe that you can give it to me am i wrong for wanting him around are they right for keeping him away from the appointments and not letting us communicate with each other even though we are the parents i do everything that they ask of me i just want him to be around when i ask my parents to let him be here they call me a selfish person please help me",parenting,youre not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your childdo your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person  or do they object only to electronic communication and dont want him involved in his childs life ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend  ask them also to understand your point of viewnow is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is bornyour mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for youconsider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit  your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address theselook online for womens resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this mattergood luck with the remainder of your pregnancy labor and delivery,1,1,1065

685,i regret ever hurting her and they mean the world to me but it feels like nothing i do seem to work ill always love them no matter what and when im with them nothing else matters i love them more then anything i dont want another guy raising my kids,parenting,how you you expressed your regret and taken responsibility for the pain thus far repair is a very essential skill in and part of developing healthy relationships your love sounds deep sit with that also sit with how shes been hurt you get to feel your hurt too and your kids in feeling all this you may also find our way to the repair if feeling all this is tough to take on seek out a local therapist to support your process,1,1,425
686,what makes my step child an  year old boy choke my daughter a  year old girl this has been going on for  years the boy tells my daughter not to tell on him he knows its wrong we have did time out spanking taking away toys and sitting on the wall i am afraid for my daughters safety,parenting,i can see why you are alarmed that is a scary situation for a parent do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional early treatment is often the key a professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses have you addressed your concerns with the childs other parent there could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues exposure to violence sexualphysical abuse drug use stressful events in his life etc it is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated andor reduced i wouldnt hesitate to have him evaluated if he hasnt been already and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication andor therapy until then i would make sure that he is always supervised under an adults care,1,1,892

697,i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me,selfesteem,as long as you try to reach others expectations you will never feel satisfied or accepted  how about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those  make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic,1,1,217
698,im a male in my s my girlfriend is in her late s shes great shes funny and smart she has a big heart and we have an excellent sex life she recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go we fight a lot its mostly my fault i must admit she doesnt like my insecurity and lack of trust i have for her i have trust issues also i cant fathom why a woman like her is with me so im always dreading when a better dude will come along i dont think shes happy shes very submissive and she loves me very much but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay i love her so much but my jealousy is not likely to diminish i never believed in the whole if you love them let them go but i do now i really want her to be happy should i end it with her she has no place to go so i feel like i cant break up with her im literally trapped,selfesteem,it sounds like there are assumptions being made regarding how she feels about you and why she is with you i would not suggest breaking up with her without first attempting to resolve your own issues you may not only regret your decision but might find that the exact same problem arises in future relationships i would recommend seeing a therapist who can help you figure out what is at the root of all of this by learning about your own insecurities and where they come from you can expect to discover new ways of responding and relating to others which will likely impact your relationship in a positive manner,1,1,612
700,my grandma had a stroke and passed away recently i lost my home and job im looking but havent found a job ive been binge watching television and binge eating,selfesteem,wow you got hit with some serious stuff all at once work relationships and housingsecurity are major needs for us and to lose all that at once has got to affect you when things go wrong it is natural for us to look for blameand the easiest person for us to blame is ourselves put that with grief and youve got a recipe for feeling awful we can start feeling so low as to want to check out with things like food and tv as you described it can take time for us to move to selfforgiveness and selfkindness in order to start moving forward again i wonder what you can do right now to improve your situation i also wonder if you may be willing to seek counseling to help you work through some of this to help with your perspective and to assist in your grieving process just reading these  sentences i get the sense of you being a nice person i hope you can show that kind of kindness to yourself in your healing,1,1,907
702,all my friends have either hooked up or had a girlfriend but me i try to be happy for them but i get really upset every time they hook up,selfesteem,if you mean hooked up as having sex with no care for the person and youd like a girlfriend then realize relationships require more complex alignment with a partner than being a sex buddypay attention to all your feelings toward a girl so that youll approach someone who attracts you for reasons in addition to sexual allurealso the process of knowing someone takes much more time than only to sleep with someonehave patience and kindness toward yourself while you get to know the qualities which attract you to a potential girlfriend,1,1,533
703,ive always thought that there wasnt much good out there for me now that things are actually going well it kind of scares me i spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured i would be alone i recently met a great woman who seems to really like me and i dont know how to process this its bothering both of us,selfesteem,congrats on having a happiness problemgo slowly and tell your partner how you feel as you discover how being loved feelson a deep level youre releasing yourself from interaction patterns which treated you poorly and unkindlytime is needed of repeated occurrences of this newfound loving behavior toward yougradually you will trust more and more that your new living relationship life is your reality,1,1,399
704,about  years ago or so i was skinny but i was still ugly i really do want to change that but ive tried  times now can i try but dont stop at school i get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and i have been bullied my whole life that i believe them how can i stop thinking about them and dont let it get in my head my parents said i dont weight that much but they do think i am fat but they tell me i am not i told my parents that i need to go to a therapist but they think i am fine and i think they dont want to deal with it,selfesteem,hey  i am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions to figure out how to change the messages that you hear and say to yourself and to get support  and it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life  take a walk over to the counseling office at school the school nurse or consider reaching out to your pediatricians office you dont have to have your parents permission to seek support for yourself  and maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health  i am rooting for you  be wise,1,1,569
705,i feel as though im suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood i convince myself im not worthy of happiness and im always afraid im doing something wrong its as if i create little scenarios in my mind and i start to believe them,selfesteem,this is an understandable response to early childhood trauma and loss  oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults  especially when we get close to someone it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life  soour body nervous system and emotions respond in the same way  they feel as if what we experienced when we were little is happening now and they go into full force to manage and protect us  sometimes the ways that happens can feel pretty bad and we can stuck in these loops of old beliefs about ourselves  therapy is a great way to interrupt these patterns process the early experiences and be able to be in the present with your current relationships  it is very possible to shift this cycle and also have meaningful healing from the experiences that caused so much hurt and distress from childhood,1,1,955
707,for the past year i have been feeling pressured to do well in school and it put a ton of stress on me i have been bullied for five years and for some reason it is now sinking in and i cant stop it for some other reason i cant find a hobby i can see myself doing without thinking bad about myself,selfesteem,you may have reached the natural end point of working very hard in school and putting up with bullies or not knowing how to step to the side of people who bully youboth conditions you have been living under pressure to perform well in school and the tension of someone bullying you are quite drainingnow is probably time to recuperate from your emotional ordealhobbies may be a little too lighthearted and distracting from the more major task of grounding yourself in feeling secure and settled especially after such arduous effort academically and sociallylet your natural self guide youif right now you need to simply grow strong again then allow this process to slowly developeventually all on its own when the time is right you will find a hobbynow is your time to trust yourself to live the rhythms of your life,1,1,816
708,im a teenage girl and i feel very bad about my weight i dont know how to make it stop,selfesteem,one way may be to take some sort of physical movement class in which you will be regarded by the teacher as one of the students not the girl who weighs a certain amountin a movement class such as pilates yoga aerobics weights dance when the standard for clothing is somewhat fitted and shows more of our physical bodies than regular clothing and to be considered as one of the students not stigmatized for how much or how little you weigh may help you be as accepting of yourself as the teacher is of you,1,1,504
710,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,i also want to note that we as a society are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves  i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive  there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything  it also wasnt his place to judge you as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others  men dont have the same range of societal expectations to navigate  you didnt deserve his rudeness,1,1,473
715,on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest    how do i fix this,selfesteem,i get how you feel you wish your body looked different and youre embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice you dont say how old you are its likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general were given the bodies were given and im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is you seem to want to stop disguising it bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what hers looks like many men go through this as well although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how were supposed to look young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them in fact other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatevers going on with you i suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear and if someone is rude enough to comment on it you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and theyll get the hint but my bet is they wont even notice ,1,1,1077
718,whether its to a guy or girl i always feel insecure talking and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough even when i am walking i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,selfesteem,i want to add that one way therapy can help with social anxiety is to give you a corrective experience  each week you sit across from someone who genuinely cares about you who doesnt judge you and who you can voice your concerns to  over time you show them more and more of yourself and as they get to know you they still care about you they still dont judge you and they still think you are amazing  find a therapist you connect with,1,1,434
719,my roommate has had a drinking problem for a while she goes out gets trashed and then expects everyone to take care of her the next morning she apologizes constantly until she feels validated she also thinks everyone hates her all the time if i dont seem anything other than happy she asks me do you hate me you hate me tell me you love me and i feel like i have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before,selfesteem,it does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem and the short answer is that you cant do anything about it only she can we cant change what other people say think or do we can only change our reactions it does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time you can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy you can reassure her that you like her if thats true but you dont have to pity her,1,1,409
720,i always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people i know that no matter what i do or how i change there will always be some people who hate me why do i feel this way,selfesteem,my first reaction to this is that it sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside build yourself up on the inside work on yourself use positive affirmations daily it would be wise for you to research some selfconstruct theory and do some selfconcept workhope this helpsc,1,1,402

732,im in my early s ive been married once and he cheated on me ever since then ive felt ugly no matter what im engaged and i still feel ugly i dont like to take pictures of myself,selfesteem,sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husbandhe did an ugly action and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling itdoes this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incidentyou may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt  it is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until nowas you address all the emotional pain youve lived through the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own because youd be focused on you not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband,1,1,756

799,she said she needed space after three days of dating and she got a boyfriend a week later i still really miss her and she told me she still likes me,relationshipdissolution,given the short amount of time you know this girlfriend there is no history on which to make a judgment about the likelihood of what she will do nextcertainly she is confusing by telling you she likes you and is with someone new  and not giving you any explanation as to why she made her decisionid suggest two possibilitiesspeak with her and ask her if she considers opening your relationship with heror simply wait and see what she does when you contact her in a friendly waypay attention to your own satisfaction levelif you get more answers from her which arent agreeable with you then it is time to put the hope for this relationship behind youthen youll have clear space to find someone who is as interested in you as you are in them,1,1,739
801,my exgirlfriend says shes bored and wants to experience life single i treated her really badly and caused meaningless fights when she didnt do anything i feel remorseful and im willing to do whatever it takes to get her back shes unhappy when i called her she was crying and said she will text me when shes ready,relationshipdissolution,were you happy with the ways she satisfied youa relationship is happiest if each partner concentrates on the happiness of the otherstrange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored rather than say they feel hurtis it possible you are being selfcritical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treatedsince shes putting up a barrier to communicating with you better for you to respect this than contact her by phone againconsider in a few weeks so each of you has time to think over your happiness with the other person to write her an email which states your interest to reopen the relationshipwho knows you may even decide by the end of a few weeks that youre fine without this particular relationshipdepending on her response to your email youll know whether and how much chance there is for the relationship to clear up the problems of the past and to continue,1,1,993
802,my fiancé and i broke up he cheated on me numerous times i kept forgiving but questioning his every move he got tired and left,relationshipdissolution,cheating on you shows a lack of commitment in addition to the emotional hurt it createsprobably you didnt actually forgive him because if you did then you wouldnt have been asking questions of his every movemaybe you were open to forgiving him   in order for forgiveness to be effective the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in youfrom what you write your fiancé didnt seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected youit is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel of having to watch him all the timeas uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you,1,1,803
805,i was in a relationship with a woman for four years we both made mistakes but i do love her    she has moved in with another lady i think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her how can i find out for sure,relationshipdissolution,has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationshipfrom what you describe your former partner is in a new relationshipit is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again that you are misinterpreting your former partners actionsif youd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner is to contact her and ask her your questiona better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone elsesince she was meaningful to you respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didnt continue as you wished,1,1,671
806,ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost  years even though i care about him he continues to hurt me    he and his wife were separated when we met now hes going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard i want to end this relationship but i dont feel like i can how can i let go,relationshipdissolution,first decide what you truly would like in the current relationship understand your reasons for staying in the relationshipthree years is a substantial amount of time to be involved with someone   whatever attachment you feel toward this man is deep and complexinstead of deciding to leave or not leave change your question to figuring out your satisfactions and dissatisfaction with the man also important is to tell the man your feelingswhatever problem you are feeling may become clarified by discussing what bothers youat the very least you will give the guy a chance to show how interested he actually is in the tension you currently feel and have felt for a while,1,1,668
807,i was in a relationship for almost five years we were friends for a few years before we got into a relationship he was a caring friendly and charming guy up until three and a half years in he started controlling me who i hung out with where i was at all times and he had a huge hissy fit if i tried to ask him the same questions all that time he just liked me as a friend and was cheating on me with my socalled friends at the end he was a nasty and narcissistic person now its hard to be social,relationshipdissolution,it sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people it is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with otherstherapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want often relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship,1,1,846
808,were not together but im still doing things for him and we are intimate hes not there for his son,relationshipdissolution,you didnt ask a direct question because i feel from what you wrote you already know the answer  i hate to sound harsh but i am a therapist that call it how i see it so brace yourselfyou will always continue to have problems with letting your childs father go as long as youdont love or respect yourself firstdont love and respect your sondont demand respect as a woman and mothergive up the goods regardless of what he does for you or your sondont hold your son as a priority in your lifehave self worth of a  etci have a feeling you are sayingi do love my son and hold him as a priority even if you dont do it for yourselfi would askare your actions of allowing such disrespect from his father proof of thati know what i have said may have gotten under your skini want it to because i feel that you have a conscience want to do better know you and your son deserve better and you can do better  believe in yourself and that you and your son do desire better and it starts with you setting boundaries with his father  you can do  it,1,1,1032
809,my husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me and i moved out he is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right im not sure if i trust that he will not go back to his old ways,relationshipdissolution,i am glad he is seeing a counselor  that is something that most men struggle with doing at times  time will tell if his actions are of good intentions  however remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships   what part did you play  did you down play his disrespect at one time  did you give up the power of your own voice  did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided  did you allow him to make you doubt yourself   in others words if you do decide to give him another chance what would you do different  not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words at all but dont allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future  if you do decide to give it another try go in with a voice with the demand of respect with your needs and wants expressed and expected  with an increase in your self worth and confidence you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions   seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self,1,1,1054
810,my husband and i got into a huge dispute he said he wanted a divorce and i left i still come home a lot and see my kids and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is what does that mean for our marriage,relationshipdissolution,in any relationship including marriage each partner will be better able to do their part by understanding their own interests and wishesconcentrate more on what youd like from your marriage  this will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of himthink over whether you wish to divorce or notsince he hasnt taken any action then for the moment you can assume he is not sure of what he wantsonce you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage including feeling uncertain if youd like it to end or continue then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotionstry to redirect your speculations about what does he want i wonder what hes thinking back to answering these very reasonable questions about yourselfthis will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with himgood luck,1,1,951
812,i keep on begging him to come back i am so unhappy with him but am so scared of being a single parent to our son i was abused as a little girl and that has made to be very abusive to men what should i do,relationshipdissolution,major change frightens almost everybodydont be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriageif you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mindconsider finding a therapist so that you have private space to talk in detail about your fears and the new ways of seeing your selfa therapy relationship since it is safe and supportive will be a good balance to having been abused suffered and unhappy,1,1,559
813,im a teenager and i just got my first job i am a month and a half in yesterday my boss pushed me to the point where i had to go to the restroom and cry she didnt see me and im glad but when i went to talk to her about it today i let a tear or two come out i hate it i feel like theyre not going to keep me anymore,workplacerelationships,how sad for youim sorry your first job is turning into a place of tensiondid the matter between you and your boss get resolveddo you feel respected by your boss and does she listen to your point of view even if afterwards she disagreeskeep an open mind over the next several weeks or few months on how you feel in your new work situationexpect to be treated fairly and reasonablyif this is not the way you feel most of the time then consider finding a new place to work,1,1,469
814,my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that im doing things she finds disrespectful even when i dont mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her she doesnt and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand,workplacerelationships,here is the truth you will never get her to understand because that would mean changing her and we cant change other people we can only change ourselves i would recommend to take the time to self reflect on what exactly it is that you are doing that is contributing to the mixup you both have very valid feelings and those wont magically go away until you address the root problem which could be many factors i am curious to know more about past relationships the both of you have had and how that plays a role in your current relationship many times we dont realize how past relationships truly impact our current behaviors,1,1,624
817,"i am in a high stress position for a tech company i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety but also demoralizing
   what can i do to manage my stress",workplacerelationships,i am curious what makes you stay sometimes managing stress is only a band aid to a bigger problem when you ask yourself what your life would look like without this stress what do you see we can easily talk about coping strategies for stress mindfulness deep breathing meditation journaling exercising etc all of which may be things to help manage your stress hearing your sentiments above i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions i wonder if the stress is more resentment and if managing is really the solution,1,1,526
825,my boss took over some work id begun concerned that she had doubts about my work i asked her for feedback i assured her that i did my utmost for customer service and asked if i was deficient she then said this was me being codependent,workplacerelationships,your boss response was insensitiveeither you can assume she was careless in her remark to you because of some unusual pressure in her own day and ask for feedback at a different time on a different projector if you dont want to take your chances of being insulted again then be your own evaluator of how well you did your workassume your work was at least good enough otherwise she would have pointed out any mistakes,1,1,417
827,"ive worked with this guy for about three years now and i knew the first time i saw him that i was attracted over time he became a very dear friend and we talked about our relationship problems family dreams and so on there was always flirtation with us and one day pretty recently it progressed to making out we agreed to keep it quiet and we did but in the back of my mind i hoped it would become something more it didnt and three months later im still not over it
   im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants were no longer in the same office which i thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so im still very drawn to him hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested hes younger than me and prefers model types but i see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship",workplacerelationships,it sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations  which is understandable on the one hand you want to get over him on the other you are still holding out hope for something more it will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more if you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system  that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him if you are wholeheartedly committed to moving past the sexual and romantic parts of your relationship and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start it is hard to just be friends when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins,1,1,840
830,i am conflicted with this guy i work with he is a coworker and close friend whom ive had a crush on since meeting him four years ago we made out once after years of flirting i was hoping for more but nothing happened i distanced myself a lot after,workplacerelationships,hello emotions run high in crush situations and when emotions run high its not uncommon for us to have emotionbased instead of factbased thoughts after reading your question i wondered how you went from making out to nothing happened i wondered if this happened because of an emotionbased thought that sounded like if he liked me he would make something happen a truer and more empowering thought might be i want something different to happen with him and i want to take a different action to see if that can happen this thought focuses more on the one thing you can control you  hopefully the thought also empowers you to think through what you can do to gauge interesttalk with him about his feelings on the matter i hope this helps and good luck to you,1,1,755
831,i believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content the father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs his coworker sent him an inappropriate video he got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that,workplacerelationships,the offspring are your propertyif you require that no other man show inappropriate content to them then require compensation for use and enjoyment of your property without your consentsend them a billwhen they do not pay it activate the local sheriff take them to small claims court and win a judgment against them for failure to compensate for the use and enjoyment of your propertyi wonder what might happen after that learn to act as man  and watch the magic happen,1,1,468
835,ive been suppressing it for quite some time but there are days when i cant make eye contact with her i think she knows and we both admitted there was some type of vibe but the overall discussion was vague i think she could possibly be dating someone that works with us its driving me crazy as an act of expression i have purchased a gift for her thats personalized i havent given it to her yet,workplacerelationships,there are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace  sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace,1,1,490
837,i was having a sexual relationship with a coworker he decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend before i got paid i told him i would have  which i thought i would but when i saw my paycheck i could not pay the  he says i lied to him about it he wants me to reimburse him  for the hotel room he decided to get he stayed at the hotel and i left i dont think its right that he want me to reimburse him  for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place he is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me i am a liar and that i should never said i was going to have  when i knew i wasnt i told him i had to pay rent and my rent was late he texted me saying i need to get two or three jobs,workplacerelationships,hello and thank you for your question it really is up to you to decide if you owe him the  if you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him then pay when you can i am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over  i know that it can be a lot of money if you dont have much but that doesnt give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts you may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc,1,1,592
838,my coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss saying i have mood swings they have no proof to back it up can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice,workplacerelationships,if this is a concern of a few coworkers make sure it is not something they see but you dont admit to  employers can suggest or something stipulate in continued employment with them  for you to go to their employment assistance provider eap if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships  no one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile  employers can be held responsible if they do not take actioncouple of things you can doask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is trueseek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist,1,1,680
840,does this go against any ethical codes are there legal ramifications,workplacerelationships,generally the ethical codes only prohibit relationships with clients there are however a few types of counselortocounselor relationships that are prohibited by the ethics codes such prohibited relationships include those between supervisors and supervisees between professors and students or any time the relationship might negatively impact your or their clients lastly some workplaces have rules against dating coworkers it would be a good idea to check if there is such a rule that applies to you,1,1,499
841,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,as in matthew    ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you although i minister in interfaith  jesus also mentions about how he lives within all of us  as in the beginning when the solar system was created in dark matter   we are created in the image of to better understand ourselves  your soul journey the date and time life  breathed into your physical part while understand that we animate the physical  faith and belief is a choice  suggestion  order a life path report  it helps you learn more about you educate and seek spiritual advisors to help you connect to the spirit   talking about it helps,1,1,657
847,my fiancé and i come from a strong christian background but both went off the straight and narrow once before he is having a hard time accepting my past especially that im not a virgin he has a hard time in general accepting himself and others    his insecurities are hurting our relationship how can i help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present,spirituality,seek deliverance from parts of your past youre struggling to let go ask the holy spirit or higher power to help you mentally take those past experiences and lay them in trust at the foot of the cross for jesus to handle acknowledge that holding onto the past is sin because it keeps you from obeying gods call to move on as you will see in the two verses i will list below jesus and the apostle paul are telling us that we have to learn how to let go of our past jesus says that anyone who is trying to move forward in his walk and call for god  but keeps looking back  is not fit for the kingdom of god  but loves you and you are a child of the most high and it is time to cleanse and strip away this resentment  there are energy medicine and eft exercises that i could show you  i will send him some positive vibes ,1,1,817
854,i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do,spirituality,im so sorry to hear that you dont feel as though your family would support you in embracing your true self because this is a very complex situation i would encourage you to reach out to a local therapist who specializes in treating lgbtq clients an experienced therapist can help you to explore your feelings around your gender identity and assist in facilitating a discussion with your family or help you prepare to have that conversation on your own i would also encourage you to contact national and local resources that can be tremendous sources of support these include the followingglbt national youth talkline  trans lifeline  trevor lifeline trevorchat trevortext  text chat to  or call at the end of the day there is the family we are born with and the family that we choose give your family a chance but if they refuse to accept you know that there are people in this world who will appreciate you validate you and love you for who you are,1,1,949
863,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,what exactly is it that you are looking for different people define themselves in different ways for example one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics still another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience at the same time who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have this may help you to know more about what you value what you like and dislike and what you want for yourself in life best of luck to you,1,1,797
871,im a christian teenage girl and i have lost my virginity my boyfriend is a christian teenager too but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner i planned to abstain from sex but i guess i wasnt clear about this because i was also tempted and led him on we continued to have sex does it mean that he isnt the one god planned for me were so young but that doesnt stop me from dreaming of a potential future together i really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason im incredibly happy for i was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him i love him very much,spirituality,having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amendsbut it is not the end of your relationship or gods will for youhave a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be talk to a counselor or your priestpastor get someone to be your guide and mentor check in with them regularlygetting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationshiphave a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation group dates public places and no alone time where temptations might ariseforgive yourself and move on,1,1,605
873,in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs,spirituality,i think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction there are many families that are united despite their differences for example a mother may be catholic and the father jewish by introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial also its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences so dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential,1,1,732
875,"there are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart ive been torn for so many years and i need help so i can move on with my life
   i experienced trauma when i was  years old and i did come out about it until i was

911,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,trauma,from what you describe about yourself i agree with you that ending your former relationship was a very wise decisionthe nightmares and flashbacks show that you were deeply affected emotionally and on the foundations of your basic naturethe way for these to stop is by the slow process of realizing how badly injured and frightened you were of your former partneronce youve stabilized yourself by accepting the tremendous harshness that was part of the former relationship then the nightmares and flashbacks will disappear gradually usually maybe all at oncethere is a possibility too that your former relationship connected with being emotionally ignored abandoned treated harshly during your time of growing up yearssince generally people choose partners who relate similarly to the ways in which they felt treated by parents it is possible that you had been badly treated while growing up and werent aware of this until going through this terrible relationshipcongratulations on ending your relationship,1,1,1005
916,my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on,trauma,was your gf always this way with you or did her withdrawal develop suddenlyalso are there any other changes going on between the two of you in terms of feeling relaxed and at ease with each other enjoying each otherits possible her physical withdrawal due to her sensitive nature about who touches her and the meaning of touch reflects an underlying emotional hesitation about her feelings toward youthis can be either strong positive or negative feelingsshe may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you and withdrawsshe may be actually withdrawing and expresses herself through the amount of touch she wants from othersbest way forward as almost always in a relationship is to have a gentle conversation to open up the tension between the two of you,1,1,764
919,my boyfriend is seeking therapy he is in his s and has some childhood issues he has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them,trauma,probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsdont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured  a relatively qualified therapist would never make this callpsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families  you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenchildhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeif the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting,1,1,955
920,i have ptsd from childhood events and other traumas as an adult i have panic attacks nightmares anger and at times depression i feel like im always on the edge or just apathetic can i fix this by myself,trauma,when it comes to trauma especially in the event that it has caused you to develop ptsd there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as  weeks as for your other concerns many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through panic attacks and depression specifically often respond well to selfhelp treatment manuals the centre for clinical interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions dont hesitate to ask,1,1,1027
922,i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,trauma,suicide is not a natural way to pass from this earth so many times it can be extremely tough to deal with because of the unnaturalness of the event we may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we couldve have done more or something to stop it but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him you are currently trying to numb your feelings those feelings as nasty as they are are meant to be felt those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation your friend has a legacy remember it and honor that legacy everyday in some small or even grand way perhaps committing or volunteering your time to help others in honor of your friendhope this helps c,1,1,736
927,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,you are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative  it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiencesif you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers  the vet center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma heres a link to a directory of vet centershttpwwwvagovdirectoryguidevetcenteraspyour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated,1,1,555
933,my mother has quite severe undiagnosed ocd diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder and maybe other mental health issues she is weeks away from moving in with me my husband and our three children i love my mother but once she gets within her own area she begins to tape all cracks and crevasses she cannot tolerate any smells,trauma,one way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits  would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevassesas long as her behavior isnt aggressive harmful to anyone unethical or immoral and youd like her to live with you then someone both sides need to be happy with the living conditionalso if you havent already done so negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks  as part of adjusting to living with your family it is reasonable to expect she respect common areas and to limit her taping habit to her private sections within the houseapproach the matter fairly and with the expectation to satisfy all the people who are affected,1,1,805
934,i have family issues and my dad was both violent and a cheater,trauma,sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painfuleveryone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by livingall of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of othersthe best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationshipsif you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of originthis realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situationsthis type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parentsexpect slow progress and expect more than a few tearsif it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourselfsending lots of good luck,1,1,1144
938,my dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that i cant function properly letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better but im terrified to get better because i dont even know who i am without the trauma ive never gotten to be myself i dont even know who i am,trauma,i am so sorry to hear that you are struggling  getting to know yourself after a trauma especially at the hands of a caregiver and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying  i would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace  you are not your trauma  you are good and you are whole  please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you,1,1,398
939,my boyfriend and i have a terrible sex life after three years of dating and i dont know what to do i have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who werent careful how can i stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend,trauma,without knowing much about your situation i would encourage you to seek out either a sex therapist who is traumainformed or a trauma therapist who has knowledge about sexual concerns  even consensual sex can be experienced as an intrusion if a partner was not careful or insensitive to your pain  it would be normal to have some difficulties with sex after such an incident,1,1,373
940,at a friends house we had some drinks and watched some television he got up and went to bed i felt sick he came out to see if i was okay and i said no i said i wanted to go home and he told me to come lay down as i laid down on the bed he started touching me a friend called me then i able to leave,trauma,i am so sorry that this happened to you and am so glad that you were able to get away  your body is yours and yours alone  i would highly recommend that you find a therapist who specializes in treating trauma in order to help you to heal from your ordeal,1,1,254

942,i was a victim of an incident ive been made fun of and have been beating myself up for it because i dont feel anyone honestly believes me there are so many other factors i deal with on a daily basis i ignore my problems when im with my friends but its scary when im alone,trauma,as you seemed to have learned the impact will not just go away treatment of trauma is like surgery it requires a skillful clinician to help resolve it while you are contemplating getting help you can focus on calming techniques like meditation and yoga they will aid you when you begin the therapeutic process,1,1,309
944,i know i was molested as a child but i have no memory of it,trauma,im not sure that i have the answer to your question but i can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist there are a list of them here httpwwwnatboardcomindex_filespagehtm you also may want to talk to someone who specializes in emdr this stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment i am not trained in this particular method but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started,1,1,518
945,im fine when we start becoming intimate but out of nowhere i will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past i start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me,trauma,have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma it can take some work but healing is possible if you feel able to it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks let him know what some helpful responses may be,1,1,322
947,as a child my parents injured my brother so they went to prison i was there when he had gotten hurt but i cant seem to remember i also cant remember being with them quite well its a blur,trauma,its important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help  the blur in your memories is your brains attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past  to recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust  when you are ready and feel safe those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories  this will help to lessen the potency of the memory help to make sense of what has happened and allow you to begin the healing process  check into therapist who are trained in emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing,1,1,639
949,my supposetobe father told me to go find my real dad we havent been getting along since i was a teenager if i said one thing that he thought was wrong i always got degraded he never said i love you he never gave us hugs hes always called me horrible names i feel hes an evil man with no feelings,trauma,hi louisiana you got it righthes supposed to be your father its tough enough being adopted unless im reading it wrong i think youre adopted what you dont need is to be verbally abused by someone whos supposed to love and protect you i dont know how old you are past teen years though or where your mom is but i bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently its your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly thats a really important part of learning how to be happycarefully choosing whos going to be in your life its tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposedtobe father but its possiblephysical distance avoid him if you dont trust youll be treated with respect and emotional distance feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability i think youre already doing that part because you dont blame yourself for his words which is wonderful i dont know if hes evil although i believe evil exists but he may be incapable of loving properly or lacking empathy as you suggest a good therapist can support you in these goals i wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult ,1,1,1160
950,i did some horrible sexual things as a kid and i regret everything can someone help me cope with myself can someone help me remember my past,trauma,im very sorry to hear this hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories however keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone i think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial it seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward in addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise i wish you the best of luck and i hope you receive the treatment that you deserve,1,1,606
951,every time my partner gets angry for anything she takes it out on me nothing i do is right and once shes mad she calls me all kinds of names and is verbally abusive she says it isnt abuse its just angry verbal bashing and that its different it gets worse each time the names are very vulgar now,domesticviolence,ultimately it is only your partner who can decide whether to stop name calling or noti would take very seriously that she doesnt show any willingness to hear and understand your point of viewin a relationship in which one person claims the right to verbally abuse the other there isnt much genuine care and trust going on at allit is never safe to open your heart to her since you cant tell in advance if youll be treated with kindness or bashingthink seriously how possible it is for you to enjoy your relationship if your partner is unwilling to accommodate your feelingsif the two of you are unable to agree on terms or discuss the problem as a mutual one not just your problem then you may wish to withdraw from the relationship,1,1,732
952,i have an emotionally abusive relationship we have been together for a year and a half he got out of prison exactly a year ago and a half ago and we have a infant i love my boyfriend and i dont want to leave without fighting for this first hes an emotionally disconnected person we never say i love you to each other every fight is worse than the last one and i dont know what to do he doesnt let me speak because hes louder than me and that makes me feel frustrated i have another problem english is my second language i pay half of the bills and every time i want to speak to him he kicks me out of the house he apologizes sometimes i feel like im the only one fighting for this he agreed to have counseling,domesticviolence,im glad that you are reaching out for help all of this sounds overwhelming and confusing all of what you discribed is common in an abusive relationship unfortunately there isnt anything you can do that will change his behavior he has to make that decision for himself it is difficult for abusers to do this because they have to admit that thier behavior is fully thier responsibility abusers a lot of times will say theyre sorry or make promises to change and then turn around and become abusive again i would strongly discourage any couples counseling because in an abusive relationship this can become very dangerous for the victim individual therapy for both of you you be a safer rout i would also encourage you to reach out to a domestic violence non profit near you because they can help you safety plan and provide counseling if you want it here is some information on the cycle of violence that might be helpful for you  httpwwwbfwcorgpdfcycleofviolencepdfi hope you are safe and i wish you the best,1,1,1007
953,he is verbally abusive when he gets mad he just yells at me at times i feel scared,domesticviolence,im sorry you are experiencing this and im glad that you are looking for help and support im not sure of all the details so take from answer what you can if you are feeling unsafe or scared in your relationship please know that there are non profit domestic violence services that can help and provide you some more support they can also safely plan with you if you choose to leave it seems that you might be feeling defeated and if thats the case a lot of domestic violence non profits provide free counseling if you are needing to talk to someone what you are going through can be overwhelming and your are taking the right steps toward healing,1,1,645
955,my kids dad and i broke up two years ago he still wants me back and i just started to fall for him again but our kids are with child protective services thats why we broke up he started to talk to other women and he put his hands on me,domesticviolence,what you are experiencing is common with survivors of abusive relationships even abusive relationships have positive moments in them and typically for survivors those are things they still love and care about of the abuser a lot of it could also be grief over the loss of the relationship and also your children a lot of time people return to thier abuser because thats the only support that they have if this is something you are going through i would encourage you to seek out a domestic violence non profit in your area because they can provide you with additional support  i dont know the whole situation but keep in mind that abusers will make promises and say what they think the other person wants to hear to get them to return attached is an example of what i am talking about httpwwwbfwcorgpdfcycleofviolencepdfbased on what you decide i would encourage you to keep  caution and boundaries it might be helpful to safety plan with a domestic violence non profit,1,1,969
956,i am a survivor of domestic violence from a past relationship even after seven years i still have horrible nightmares i wake up in sweat and the dreams feel so real,domesticviolence,nightmare are actually very common for survivors of domestic violence if they are affecting you the the point where you feel like you need to do something you may want to consider processing your memories of the events with a trained trauma therapist another good option may be to attend a support group for survivors where you could process your memories in a safe space where others will be able to provide support and understanding for what you went through as well as encouragement for the strength it took you to get out of that relationship you may also want to consider completing a screening or assessment to rule out posttraumatic stress disorder as well,1,1,663
957,after a domestic abuse situation i went to a therapist and then my husband went the therapist discussed her assessment of borderline personality disorder with me she then told my abuser the results of my tests,domesticviolence,it sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission  there are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however  for example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that personif you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality you can always contact your states counseling regulatiory board  the board will then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action,1,1,619
958,my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now throughout the entire first day that we met he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another that same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed the next two days were a repetition of the first day on the third night my mother finally caught us and i was kicked out of my house i left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple it was very hard for us his stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month after that it was a downward spiral we were constantly arguing about money food and our families we kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument after six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started one afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one he told me to let him leave or he would hit me he had once promised he would never touch me so i challenged him to do it he slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me i havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now i dont live with him i dont depend on him and we dont have children we both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly he always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i dont ever make the effort to try to be okay ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me i know he has to change that on his own i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned is there hope for a better future together,domesticviolence,hi winters i learned a long time ago that i cant ever predict who will change and who wont i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change only you can decide how many years to give it i see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though what are you waiting foralthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change it doesnt work that way just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work you can only decide when youve paid too much i bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you hes not your only support,1,1,972
959,ive been with my boyfriend over  years he cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant he is physically and mentally abusive towards me i have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues however he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything im always there when he needs my help he tells me although i help him doesnt mean that i am a good person he always discredits me as a woman and its hurtful i spend most day crying and feeling lonely i am unhappy and unsure of what i need to do,domesticviolence,that sounds like a very hurtful situation unfortunately without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop i do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship as an abuser his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means i recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area i have worked closely with harbor house of central florida and know they provide housing transportation and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship there is help out there and you are not alone if you need any additional resources in your area please dont hesitate to contact me,1,1,737
960,ive known my boyfriend for several years we were friends for a long time in  we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state i planned to move in with him in  after i finished school and he found a job however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time we decided later to make it work shortly after i found out that i was pregnant i wanted to tell him during his next visit however he never came to see me and instead asked me for money after i gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts    soon after i experienced a miscarriage i texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care i was extremely hurt by this i still decided to move back as i had originally planned he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him during this time i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know although he says he did i hardly ever see him he never got a job which was in the original plan    after that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together once we got back together i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in i thought he had too but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman in fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her when i confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car i dont know what to do,domesticviolence,there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life i think youll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect,1,1,739
961,now i have anger and trust issues how can i treat this and fix myself,domesticviolence,i will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this however i highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas that would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issuethe important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you angry yes at your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you having trouble trusting of course the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries where you end and i begin,1,1,1034
962,when i got home my boyfriend and i got into an argument he got upset and he started hitting his face that is the first time he has ever done that but i would be lying if i said that didnt scare me i locked myself in the room,angermanagement,sounds scary to watch  i agree with youmaybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotionsnow that the incident is past bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss itjust the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time may be restorative to himat the very least you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place,1,1,511
964,my roommate is a unapologetic person who doesnt care who she hurts she never apologizes to me or my family she made me lose my temper today to the point where i was using swear words in front of my mom and brother,angermanagement,you must be feeling frustrated about how to resolve this some people seem to really provoke emotional responses in us one thing to learn for a quick review of yourself when you are provoked is to pay attention to your body notice your heart rate fists clenched some warmth going through your body and these are signs that the interaction is toxic for you move out of the room say something calling to both of you and let things simmer down before responding when you are able to calm your body think of ways to bring the issue to her attention using positive words but holding your ground if she doesnt listen ask someone to come with you to talk to her about it if she still wont listen reassess your expectations of herfinally if you need to  you may have to consider changing the status of your rooming together,1,1,814
966,sometime when small thing happen like losing a comb i get furious i even start throwing things do i have a problem,angermanagement,you easily get angered because you havent trained your mind to ration how your brain interprets the events you experience as a result you act after an event happens because you do not ration and question to find out if your interpretations of events are rational and legitimateanger is an emotion that communicates to us that something is not right and we feel threatened and have to fight back in self defense all it takes is one event to be trigged and the rest is history anger management can help you identify what triggers you so that you can train yourself to be able to interpret events in a rational wayanger is not the problem it is what we do when we get angry that is the problem,1,1,690
970,when i think of things people put me through in the past i get upset all over again and take it out on everyone ill be mad for nothing at all and have a attitude with everyone for no reason,angermanagement,it sounds like you have had difficulty in processing what happened to you in the past and because of that difficulty in moving past what happened to you when you are reminded of what happened you get angry all over again please know that it is possible to remember what happened but to also not have the same emotional response it is very common to have difficulty processing a traumatic situation that occurred in the past many people go through this a good therapy designed to assist with this type of issue is emdr try to find a therapist who is trained in emdr to help you with processing these memories so that you dont have the same emotional response every time you think about what happened best of luck to you,1,1,718
972,i get really mad easily at my parents and family,angermanagement,anger is usually pain and frustration which cannot be expressed directly to people in your surroundingshow someone can be less angry is by directly saying your thoughts and feelingsone approach is to to tell either or both parent that you would like them to hear youknowing you tried to be heard adds to your own selfrespect regardless of their willingness to do as you askif you are simply left with no chance to make yourself understood by them then look for ways to expand your social support system so you do have people who willingly hear and talk with youeven if social media groups are the only format available to you it is at least some type of human interaction and interest in who you are,1,1,699
974,i snap easy and push people away i need help before i push my boyfriend away,angermanagement,death of someone with whom we had fond involvement is sad   accepting that a person is permanently gone from this earth is unsettling and can feel painfulthat you had no current contact with this person doesnt exclude the meaning or feelings from within your relationship with this person     relationships dont require a time measurement in order to affect us   your question acknowledges the process of adjusting to life without the chance to see or hear from this person againit is normal to grieve so be gentle and not critical of yourself when you feel yourself missing this person,1,1,586
976,i get angry and act out it scares my wife and child,angermanagement,yes you can  if you cannot control your temper who can  you have more power of your emotions thoughts and feeling than you are giving yourself credit for  if this is scaring your wife and child you need to get control of it immediately  try going to an anger management class  it will help to discover what is the root cause of your anger what triggers it and how you can controlmanage it  if you cant go to a class try self help books or even better yet counseling and support of a professional counselor,1,1,505
977,were in an eight year relationship my boyfriend drinks a lot he experienced childhood trauma i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts,angermanagement,you shouldnt need to educate yourself on violent outbursts  he is the one in the position to change his violent outbursts   they are his behavior not yours  all youre trying to do is have a relationship with this guythe one task to do is during a quiet time to tell your boyfriend the way you feel about his outburstshis answer whether he denies having a problem blames you for his problem tells you the problem isnt so bad why are you complaining tells you a lot about his willingness to changewhether or not he considers himself to have a problem and wants to change himself is very good for you to knowthis tells you what to expect from him in future   you can reflect and plan ahead for your own life depending on your tolerance and willingness to live with what he answers you,1,1,781
978,any time things get heated the past gets brought up i raise my voice at her to try to get a point across she asks openended questions but always has to turn my own answer against me shes seven months pregnant i have drank in the past but im not dependent on alcoholi only drink at social events,angermanagement,have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of yousince your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them  the more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible momentsif you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control then try scheduling a discussion about them  this by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about,1,1,601
979,everything just makes me upset,angermanagement,anger often comes with a lot of other emotions consider what else you may be feeling at the same time and keep track of your different mood changes you may be able to notice patterns such as being more frustrated when you dont sleep well if you do feel as though you are mad all the time can you think of any exceptions so you can see what is different in those times,1,1,367
980,my son claims that hes been having extremely violent thoughts and dreams not violent like hes hurting someone but violent thoughts like horrible things happening to his loved ones he explained one of his dreams the other day and it was so violent it was sickening it was far beyond anything in a horror movie he says he cant help these thoughts they just pop up please help,angermanagement,if your son is reporting extremely violent thoughts and dreams please have an psychological evaluation done by a psychiatrist now before it gets even worse for him to bare  dont take his reports lightly  for him  to tell you he knows that something is not right  he is seeking and needing help  get it immediately  best to be safe than sorry,1,1,341
982,i been having anger problems a lot lately it only takes one word wrongly said to set me off i use to not be like this until i got with my soontobe husband i think his mood and rageanger problems have rubbed off on me a lot i dont get nearly as bad as he does but i yell almost constantly and i cant seem to just stop i have two young babies that have to hear this and i dont want my girls growing up with a mommy like i have been lately i just dont know how to get back to my old self,angermanagement,with me knowing that a healthy relationship usually includes respect trust appreciation companionship spiritual solidarity domestic support feeling of being cherished and  sensuous affection i am wondering if you are lacking in several if not all of these needs in your present relationship  before he becomes your husband you should examine these areas and see if they are high in rating  otherwise yes this relationship will affect your girls and you negatively  i would suggest relationship counseling specifically premarital  not be surprised if through the process you realize that this relationship is not the best choice for you and your children,1,1,653
984,i have not been able to really sleep i stay up all times of the night not even knowing why every day i feel like i have anger inside of me i have a little family but i cant open up to them like i want to i have a son and i feel that i take my anger out on him by screaming at him,angermanagement,best question iswhat are you so angry about  you cant stop being so angry until you figure out what is the root of your anger  if you feel like you have anger inside while i am sure you do  taking it out on your son is only passing on the hurt and anger  this will be inside him too  get some professional help so that you can be happy and have a happy child,1,1,358
985,my issue isnt resisting angry urges its the anger itself my rage is extreme and vastly disproportionate to the direct stressor it causes violent thoughts but i never act i stay lucid enough to know the rage is violent not me i dont want to drown myself in anger and resentment,angermanagement,knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel are fine qualitiesanger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into wordstry thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such timesalso if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations   even without drinking the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memoryif this describes part of your childhood then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express,1,1,831
986,i dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger thats really the only one i feel,angermanagement,well then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you havewhat is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings  your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feelsometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they werein some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind  by knowing where your difficulties started you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelingsalso spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are  often people who have difficulty in expressing themselves suffered shame and humiliation as a child  they have a chronic sense of worthlessness and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression  by having a good time being with yourself you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating,1,1,1055
987,the sounds of eating and breathing gives me headachesmostly mouth breathing and snoring it makes me angry and i want to solve it myself,angermanagement,probably good to know in what type of situations you are in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoringif youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchenbasically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling themdepending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds or not willing to change or not has a good deal to do with next stepsi dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the headone path i dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered or dismissing your own sensitivity someoneyour needs matter,1,1,870
988,"i need answers to my anger possessiveness and urges
 i am angry all the time i push people away so much that i actually blow up on people now because they ask me how my day is or was i have a possessiveness to someone who is not even mine i have these urges to hurt someone really bad i want to see them beg for me to stop hurting i want to hear their agonizing painedfilled voices what is wrong with me",angermanagement,what result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describemaybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions with how you would wish to feel from relating to otherssince you ask what is wrong with me there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in returnthis is true even with imagining doing harm to otherswhat are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting othersbesides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors what gain which is not evil do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being,1,1,659
989,when i see something i dont like i go off like a ticking time bomb i go from  to  really quickly,angermanagement,sometimes we react to situations immediately without thinking of the consequences of our actions typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly one of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing when faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend  minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to  and breathe out even slower counting to  while focusing and thinking only about your breathing after doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate good luck,1,1,716
990,every time i speak he says i anger him also when hes mad at something like work he gets angry at me i feel like were so distant from each other now we used to laugh all the time and i feel like he lets too much negativity in what should i do weve been married for two years but together for seven,angermanagement,hi newark it sounds to me like your husband is going through something and i think you understand that you might feel very helpless sad and disrespected at the same time hes changed its unfair for him to blame you for his emotions his mood issues are about him not you and hes either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries you can let him know when you feel disrespected and whats not okay with youhe may be experiencing depression which often shows up as irritability in men it could be that hes not telling you something or hes unaware of his emotional processes you can try a im really worried about you you dont seem happy and i dont know how to help you some things are happening that arent okay with me will you see a therapist approach perhaps you could go with him the first time  its about a combination of compassion selfrespect and seeking professional help i believe i wish you well,1,1,979
991,im a teenager i get random spurts of anger like complete pure rage i figured it was hormones but others notice it too i get selfdestructive i used to cut but stopped now when i get mad i bite my arms and fingers pull my hair scratch my face or punch my thighs basically i do things i can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom i dont live in a bad household i have a great family a great relationship with my boyfriend and a good job i have no idea what this is and i dont know how to control it its over any little thing tonight it was because i couldnt get my earrings out this happens maybe two to three times on a good week and its always over stupid petty things,angermanagement,hi im glad you wrote in general when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectivelywe just want to avoid it as quickly as possible cognitive behavioural therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively you say that your behaviours are self destructive and i agree it sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem this is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you again a good therapist can help you learn whats behind your shame and selfharm your feelings are normal and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help,1,1,923
992,i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month,sleepimprovement,theres a narrative approach that we call nightmare rescripting that may be helpfulsince we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening we try to alter them while we are in a waking state  in a nutshell this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have typically there is an element of fear danger or helplessnesssecond we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment control competence andor safety in other words if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted we might change the events of the story so that you call the police get to a place of safety or even fight back and protect yourselfthird you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again so that it becomes a well rehearsed story the effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping this new more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream best of luck,1,1,1084
994,i get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two it usually happens in bed at night but i occasionally experience this during the day i have a benign brain tumor but the doctor said it is not associated with this,sleepimprovement,im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening i know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature as far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on these are just some thoughts but i think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start,1,1,695
995,it takes me a long time to fall asleep id estimate about two hours i often have nightmares starting with being eaten by a monster and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of  years also my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition i was under a lot of stress and life lost meaning after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved however in the past couple months i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning how can i solve this issue,sleepimprovement,"youre noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep there
is quite a bit going on which may be anxiety related it sounds like the
dreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you had
around the time of your break up the difficulty with your fathers business
and your mothers health issues these connections to past events may be
important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about
what your dreams may be trying to tell you there is no exact science to
dreams but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates to
significant themes in their lives i think that exploring these issues further with
a therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress trouble sleeping and frightening dreams",1,1,786
996,sometimes  times a night,sleepimprovement,perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems  i find that change states while sometimes difficult are very exciting  they give you opportunity to grow more rapidly  so i say congratulations  mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg,1,1,274
999,my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex,intimacy,the answer lies in what the outcome will be how will things end if you find out he had sex with a prostitute will you leave will you try to work things out the multiple versions are concerning he seems unable to be truthful and this is damaging your relationship before considering marital therapy please find a counselor for yourself the right therapist can help you uncover what is right for you,1,1,397
1010,my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me    he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way,intimacy,because the acrobatics and excitement of sex has nothing to do with the meaning of deeper emotional attachment to another person with whom we are in a relationshiptry to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband,1,1,346
1012,"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this a while back  years ago i asked him to stop drinking so much and he agreed i caught him one night drinking behind my back i confronted him and he lied but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again lately my husband has been drinking on and off but i noticed it was every single night i didnt like this for our new years resolution we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption he was on boardno more drinking every night
 the other night i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing it took a couple of days but tonight i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing but i couldnt wait i asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and i cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking he slurred a bit and said no i asked if he had been drinking but he snapped and said no i went into our room to sleep leaving him on the couch  im not sure if im overreacting or not i just feel like im so honest with him about everything and i expect the same honesty he is a good husband in every other regard",intimacy,as exasperated as you feel and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you changing this is up to himdoes he care that youre upset with him for drinking more than he can handledoes he care about you more than drinkingliving with an alcoholic which is how his behavior sounds is lonely and frustratingconcentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinkingyour happiness matters  his ignoring of what youre talking about doesnt mean your requests are unreasonablebe prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves or notavoid the expectation that you can convince him to changepeople change only when they realize their life can improve by changing  he doesnt sound like this at least now,1,1,761
1014,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,wait what  normal teenage experiences   a pedophile is someone that is attracted to children meaning under your age category   this is regarding mostly adults that are over age of    you are only one year apart  try and focus on friendship and work on keeping yourself busy in activities so that you are not having these type of thoughts  direct this energy into a more productive activity like sports reading biking exercising or something other than negative thought patterns  dont attract what isnt supposed to be part of your life  good luck,1,1,545
1022,i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago    why this is happening and what can i do about it,intimacy,sexual desire seems to be straightforward  i like someone and i become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them  but that idea does not always take into account other factors stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs  when we are overstressed for example we often find ourselves ill at the same time  can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress additionally focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection  while this may seem counter intuitive it makes sense in the word of stressfinally its never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor as well you did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body as well,1,1,962
1026,"for some reason i feel very uncomfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body in certain poses on social media i know she is proud of her body and i respect that but i dont feel comfortable with her openly showing off her body the way she does
   anytime i bring it up to her she thinks im calling her a whore how can i deal with my girlfriend showing off her body on social media and not hurt her feelings",intimacy,ask her to consider your feelings not only her own defensiveness that she is called a whore by youclearly since youre writing on a site which offers psychological and emotional support and guidance you do not consider your gf to be a whoreshe may not realize or considered that you are somewhat protective of who sees her body   in the end she may not want the privacy over her body which you are encouraging her to haveat least you will have the satisfaction to know you stated your actual reasons for your request and did not rely on the ones she imagined you have,1,1,566
1027,my fiancé and i have been together for  years and our relationship has always been good the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me    i recently found out he cheated on me with another women he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on,intimacy,helloyes many couples have survived infidelity how sincere is he with wanting to work it outthat means alot in recovery the key is to understand that cheating is a choice please dont take the betrayal personallook at the foundation of the relationship  is there cracks that can be healed how do you feel about betrayal honest communication is the key to healing never assume monogamy discuss it no one can tell you if you should stay or go that is a very personal decision start by setting up face to face time to discuss the affair and emotions  if this may be hard please get a counselor or therapist that can meditate this journey just remember even if you decide to leave you still need support to heal just because you leave the situation  the trauma still exists,1,1,768
1036,my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive     i love him so much why do i do this,intimacy,there could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away it could be part of how you were raised it could be because of culture it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you pushing him away what is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect so what if you arent a hugger a kisser or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship there are many ways to show affection that arent physical words of affirmation giving of time andor gifts etc if your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching,1,1,732
1039,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,keep doing the crossdressing since you like ityour problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about itnot keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life  usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about usonce you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing  based on their handling of this intimate part of your life you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to themsecrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time   the person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship felt good or at least not worrisome,1,1,774
1044,im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this,intimacy,have you said anything to your husband about the way youre feelingstart with thissex is after all a two person enterpriseif he would like to talk about the way youre feeling great and wonderful  the two of you already are continuing to grow trust in your communication and relationshipif he doesnt want to talk about how youre feeling then youre facing a different problemyour feelings are real and need to be handledif you end up facing your feelings of frustration about your husband not wanting to have sex with you on your own then does your husband give you a truthful sounding reason as to why notask what explains his disinterest in having sex with youif he doesnt want to address this question then you are a little further down the rung of trust and care about youdepending on how satisfied you are with his answers will guide you on how much dissatisfaction you can live with and why longterm,1,1,902
1047,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,im sorry for how youre feeling in your marriage lately  are you and your husband able to talk directly about your feelings  the way two people connect is usually by talking with each other to understand what each one cares about and thinksyour current emotional suffering is the natural result of being married to someone who shows no interest in doing thisif your husband wants to start talking with you then there is a chance the two of you can reconnect  if he doesnt want to participate in the relationship with you then start to think if its possible and for how long to get emotional support from friends and family who do care for youalso a question for the future is to understand what the value of your marriage is to you besides having a connection to your husband,1,1,774
1052,my wife and i have a great relationship except for our sex lives we are pretty transparent and honest and basically she feels bad because she never wants to have sex she doesnt have the desire shes also never orgasmed she feels like a terrible wife and fears ill cheat on her she doesnt know why last time we had sex she cried and felt bad and didnt know why she cried however she also told me that the last time we had sex she felt me in her but it just felt ehh and wanted to stop that makes me feel really awful we rarely have foreplay everything i try tickles her so she makes me stop we are both frustrated but very much in love she and i are in our early s were married and we have a baby on the way,intimacy,that sounds really challenging for both of you differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict i would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isnt as arousing as is possible there are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships,1,1,531
1057,my husband and i have been married for seven years and in that time we have only had sex four or five times others have told me that most men would have left me by now honestly i think i have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing i want to be better connected with my husband,intimacy,there are many different ways that can be approached in your situation i would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test i would want to know if there are any medical issues in your low sex drive where is your husband in this situation is he resentful accepting demanding or neutral what is your past sexual history has this had an affect on your current issuehas there been problems in your past with abuse of any kind understand that intimacy is more than sex what other ways can you be close to your spouse it sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of youcouples counseling would be a great place to start all of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be establishedyou need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse,1,1,838
1064,im always questioning her about things such as who she is texting and talking to on the phone why she is always on social media checking her phone records and going through her phone i do this knowing that i have never found any reason for her to be cheating and i have no reason to,intimacy,understand the reasons you feel mistrustful  even though you arent finding evidence of cheating your weak sense of faith in your wifes behavior is worth examining bc trust is fundamental to a good relationshipit is possible you dont have faith in yourself to accurately tell whether someone is telling you the truth or whether you are interpreting evidence accuratelyanyone who has themselves had their trust severely violated will feel uneasy to naively trust what is on face valuethe work requires observing your own confidence in gradually feeling safe that what someone tells you is true is actually trueexamine as much evidence as needed of whether what the other person tells you theyre doing does in fact take placewhen the facts line up and show you no reason to be fearful then you will be one step closer to trusting yourself to trust someone else,1,1,857
1065,so many people lie and its hard to tell who speaks the truth who do i trust i dont even trust my family or friends,intimacy,start by trusting yourselfthis is harder to do than it may soundif a person trusts themselves their actions decisions way of handling matters then evaluating whether or not to trust another human being becomes much easieralso dont be in a rush to trust someone   trust takes time to develop   first observe someone listen to the person whether they follow through   repeat this process multiple times which requires time to accomplishat a certain point in this process you will start to feel whether or not the person is trustworthy or not,1,1,539
1066,nothing weve tried has worked so far,intimacy,probably what you should do is decide whether you can continue having a romantic and sexual relationship with someone to whom you dont feel like having sexfive years is long enough to know that the way you feel toward your partner is more than likely going to remain this waytalk with your gf about your feelings because she may not wish to be in a relationship in which her partner is not sexually attracted to her,1,1,415
1068,today my boyfriend broke up with me because he says i stress him out with me not trusting him and always accusing him of things it hit me that i still hold on to every bad thing my mother has ever said to me and everything that anyone has ever done to me i act as if hes going to do it too,intimacy,the relationship history with your mother was probably quite painful and left emotional hesitation to avoid similar dynamics with othersif you havent done so already then tell your bf about the difficulties you had with your mother and ask him to be sensitive to not trusting easilythe two of you can collaborate in creating more security in relating to him   maybe he can tell you sooner about particular times he feels frustratedthen you will know and be able to address your own sore points and by handling these differently than through the years with your mom toward your bfyour process of feeling and thinking in terms familiar from your growing up years is normal   each of us is this waythe difference is you know and would be willing to develop new patterns of relating to someone which is based on more care and trust than you knew growing up,1,1,852
1069,i have cheated on my husband of five years roughly ten times i pretend we arent married at my work recently he has caught on but i lie to cover it he use to talk to girls online but i have caught myself constantly having a affair,intimacy,i dont know that i should tell you to get a divorce some would but i think there is something much deeper going on for you i would be more concerned about figuring out the deeper reason you are having an affair do you have shame and guilt do you not like that you are doing this to your husband do you see yourself as a bad person or do you just want more all of this can be handled if you really want to fix it in your marriageyou can have more in your marriage with some help you can stop having affairs if you get help i would encourage you to seek help right away and find out what you are missing that is driving you to commit affairs i actually believe that if you get a divorce you will probably keep repeating the same behavior with another person let me know if you desire more help,1,1,791
1071,he is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault he bashes me to our young child and he is addicted to a few substances,intimacy,strengthen your own belief in your right to a decent life and respect of who you arefrom the brief description you write your husband has very limited capacity to recognize how others feel and even less capacity to empathize with the personthe best you can do is convince yourself of your own worth and associate with others who believe similarly about your qualities,1,1,367
1073,we cant hold a conversation together the blame is always pointed at me we have no intimacy,intimacy,it is hard to hold onto a partner that isnt available emotionally or is lashing out when you face any kind of coflict between youthe conditions needed for healthy intimacy can not grow when there is an absence of common ground or lack of a sense of safe space between youlearning to nurture yourself in this type of situation is vital and comes first  if there are to be better conditions to grow the kind of relationship you both feel safe and valued in it needs to be a shared missionbut healthy intimacy begins within and you can grow and thrive no matter the willingness or emotional availability of another  i recommend you find a good guide to walk this path back home to a deeper peace in you  if the relationship can be healed more will become clear as you feel more ease and harmony within yourselffor more resources related to healthy inimacy i invite you to visit httpwwwcounselingocwomencom,1,1,902
1075,my spouse seems to get very bothered by me speaking asking questions or getting excited in a way that he thinks is too much he comes across as acting like whatever it is im talking about is nowhere near as important as whatever hes thinking about which he believes will go over my head,intimacy,good for you to realize you have just as much right to talk and be heard as he doesand that your words deserve as much respect as his doat a time which is relatively calm introduce the topic of your hurt feelings from his difficulty listening to you speakif it is so tell him you value his opinion and that when you talk there is no bad intention toward himask him to explain what bothers him so much about your manner of expressionthen as a mutual project both of you could develop a new system of talking with one another which avoids hurting your feelings and the distress he feels when he hears you talkthe above assumes good will by each of youit is also possible he simply has no interest in listening to you or to develop new understanding which makes doing so more likelythis possibility introduces an entirely new subject of how to live with someone who has no interest in you,1,1,885
1076,he leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me he gets defensive when i ask him stuff we havent had sex in two months he says its because hes not working im pregnant he doesnt like it here and he hasnt been on the mood lately,intimacy,well there certainly is distance he creates between the two of youwhether or not the reason is from his cheating on you is impossible to tell based only on the information here providedyou could open a general discussion about the lack of closeness you feel   maybe hell be more responsive to talk about emotions than about specific actions hes done or not donemostly entitle yourself to the quality relationship youd like to have  your discomfort and distress are valid and theres no good reason to live with conditions which keep these moods in place forevergive yourself time to plan your next move especially since having a baby will add to each of your responsibilitiesyou didnt write how long the problem you describe has continuedone possible outcome if its been a short time is he will resolve whatever currently drives his withdrawn behaviors from youyour life your outcometrust yourself to know when the time is right to stay or to go,1,1,944
1077,after receiving counseling we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder when i offer compromises in our disagreements he does not seem to understand we cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white my husband has asked that we go to counseling this time in the past it has been my suggestion we are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved he cannot see the whole picture when i attempt to explain my side to him,intimacy,i never heard of a marriage mediator beforesince you already went to counseling and the therapist observed your husbands tendency to see black and white in life and because counseling functions on a deeper level than a mediator generally does a marriage mediator sounds like a step backwardswhy not go to a financial mediatorthis would satisfy your husbands black white outlook and may satisfy you too because no emotions are expected in financial discussion and the relationship suffers from an expectations surrounding emotion,1,1,528
1078,with college over my boyfriend and i have such different work schedules since i cant see him often i want to talk more on the phone he plays video games while talking to players so often i feel ignored i find myself always telling him what to do in relation to me things he should know,intimacy,directly tell him what you write hereeither he is losing interest in you or he is simply caught up in short fun w his friends and video gamesa conversation on this subject will give you more clarity on your question,1,1,215
1079,ive pretty much been on my own since day one im a middle child of five and i cant seem to put my trust in anyone it took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend every time i realize that i have feelings for someone i freak out and never talk to them again i really want some help,intimacy,one way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention backstart with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate  youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer onesonce you start seeing your success this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentratethe task of selfreminding is the same whether for long or short time periodsalso before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problemif there is then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate and not some medical reason preventing thisbefore someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work,1,1,856
1080,i was with my friends at the park and we were talking and having fun after a while i met a girl there we talked and flirted for a while then we gave our numbers to each other and left we talked for a few months then we met up again she kissed me so i assumed we were dating then i found out she has a boyfriend,intimacy,im sorry for your disappointment with this girlmaybe next time you start to like someone talk with the person to find out if they feel similar to you   this way you have a good chance to avoid being hurt in the way you describe hereeven if the person doesnt give you a straightforward answer to their feelings for you youll gain a little more information by listening to how seriously they consider your question what their body language is like whether or not the person seems sincerelisten to your gutif you feel unsure the person likes you as much as you like them then wait a little while to see if your feelings about the person or their feelings about you change and in what direction they changekeep yourself informed as best you can so youll know you did as much as possible to kiss someone who understands your kiss the way you mean it to be understood,1,1,861
1081,my husband had an emotional affair with his exwife in november she invited him to dinner alone with their daughter i wasnt aware of this until after pm when i asked where he was he had been drinking and i told him not to come home that night the next morning we talked about going to counseling he went out that night with friends and said his exwife wasnt going i found out in april that she did go i gave him the chance to get everything out in the open i found out that he stayed that second night with her i asked if they slept in the same bed and he said yes both nights his daughter wasnt there the second night he claims they didnt have sex but what else should i think,intimacy,i agree with you that professional counseling is a wise choice for your relationshipyour husband may not know want to know or want to discuss with you what his true feelings are toward you and the exthe topic is very heated which is why discussing these matters alone may do more harm than goodusually people start deeply complex emotional matters discussion and get so upset the conversation goes off track and unintended hurts happenin a therapist office the two of you will be guided on talking about these critical areas and this will be much more productive than trying to do so only with the two of you,1,1,608
1083,shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family we dont talk much because of it also we have little fights we want to work it out but we dont know how,intimacy,maybe your girlfriend feels torn in her emotions between loyalty toward her family and toward investing herself in a relationshipthere are so many maybes that the best way to strengthen your relationship is to ask your girlfriend if she feels any pressure from her family to avoid involving herself with youif the answer is no then continue to talk with each other as to what would make you each feel more secure with one anotheralso more simply are the  two of you able to resolve the little fightsdifferences of opinion are normal between two people even to the point of each person feeling they are the only one who knows the correct answeras long as each one of you has the goodwill to give a little then the fights are a healthy way to respect and care about each otherif the fights are about the same topic which repeats itself then there are strong differences between the two of you including the possibility that her family places and she is willing to accept some obstacle to this relationship,1,1,1003
1084,i went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide when i went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that i put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders he was very angry that i went to him to do that am i in the wrong for going to him to reach out he helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why i thought of him to reach out he made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help why did he react this way towards me i think hes being selfish,intimacy,your compassionate reach out to the friend is praiseworthythat your ex bf has trouble accepting your gesture as kindness shows your ex bf is not seeing the situation clearlyi believe your ex bfs words about feeling burdened by your actionhowever he is mixing up his own responsibility to know the root of his feelingsblaming you for feelings he doesnt understand within himself is unfair and not helpful to anyone including himfrom what you write you did nothing wrong and your action toward the potential suicider was graciousmy only guess which is also very general about your ex bfs behavior is that he doesnt yet fully understand himself and finds blaming others easier than understanding himself,1,1,700
1085,my boyfriend has this close female friend it always bothered me because of how close they are so i decided to meet her that made the situation worse because they were even closer than what i thought they acted like a couple rather than friends with each other there was no physical interaction but he talks to this girl a lot what can i do leaving him isnt an option,intimacy,well as hurtful as witnessing your boyfriends closeness with his female friend im glad you saw firsthand the dynamic of your concernthere isnt anything you can directly do to stop his relationship with this ladyit is possible to influence his side of their relationshipdirectly telling him your discomfort with how close the two are may make him pause before engaging with her in a discussion  this is nothing to count on since the control is in his hands and not yoursim sorry to read that the option to leave this relationship is out of the questionthe only way left is to get used to the fact that you dont like this aspect of your boyfriend and this is a disheartening outlook overall to you and to your relationship overallif after repeated effort to influence him by your opinions your effort to adjust to a situation you dont like if at all possible consider a longterm plan to discontinue this relationship because by that time it may feel very oppressive in your life,1,1,976
1086,im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do,intimacy,it took a lot of courage to share what must be so shameful to you and to ask for help regardless of your sexual attractionorientation id encourage you to get honest with yourself and your partnerfiancee and put a temporary hold on your wedding plans  getting married will not resolve your acting out it seems to me you need more space time to sort through with an experienced therapist more of your sexsexuality storyline and apparent anxiety surrounding the upcoming nuptials in the immediate i encourage you to also take the initiative to have yourself tested for stds etc and if youve been sexually intimate with your partnerfiancee she needs to be similarly tested best wishesresources for your consideration  the book not gay sex between straight white men by jane ward  httpwwwscarecoveryorg  httpsslaafwsorg,1,1,814
1090,she has lied about every aspect of her life shes created three fake relationships the most recent one is concerning because she has fake photos phone calls and text messages and its with a married man with kids her lying is becoming dangerous because she could ruin lives,intimacy,is being friends with this person safe for youliars dont generally distinguish who they bring down with them or in service to themselvesstep one is to understand a true friendship which is based on trust is probably not possible with this personif youd like to offer words of advice to protect her from herself then try gently pointing out that some of her actions which you know about may come around to harm herthere is only a small chance she will be open to hearing youpeople who lie are also very fearful of trusting others including themselves  she may prefer to keep status quo than open her own emotional pain to understand what created the need to lie in the first place,1,1,679
1092,my boyfriend lost his dad to suicide he says that because his dad died so did his heart he says that he cant be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again why is he doing this when we were very happy together he says that i have done nothing wrong but he just cant be with me,intimacy,i am sorry to learn of this  you must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken  to begin he is correct  you have done nothing wrong  this is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive  it is fear  it is anger  it is extreme sadness  it is feelings of abandonment  it is intense emotional pain  it is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional lossi am not familiar with how old this post is but often it will require time and understanding  if he speaks with you encourage him to get grief counseling  do not encourage it for your relationship encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad  start there  good luck,1,1,647
1093,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,intimacy,you are in an abusive relationshipnot because of your boyfriends silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful never admits he is wrong and never apologizes it is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship you can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner you can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship i wish you well always,1,1,498
1096,my husband cheated while i was pregnant with our son with a socalled friend this was before we were married we split and eventually worked things out i thought i trusted him so we got married now he flirts with girls in front of me ive talked to him but nothing helps,intimacy,this sounds very painful for youare you able to tell him how his flirting affects youmaybe he doesnt care enough to change and maybe he doeslong term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices put up with it which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship   or of course you can decide to end the relationship  this choice is quite significant now that you have a child together  give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome,1,1,494
1097,the father of my kids and i have been broken up for about three years now we always found our way back to each other he had a baby with someone else hes with but still shows the same love he showed when we was together when hes around he even gets jealous but he ignores my calls,intimacy,your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointmentyou know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship youd likeit is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothingreflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wishdepending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been,1,1,483
1098,every day for five years my husband mentally abused me and said he will change i have a child with him i try so hard to stay strong for her but at this point i am completely broken i am holding on to nothing but hope and have been for years is there any hope or am i wasting my time,intimacy,i think your own awareness will not allow you to continue in a bad relationshipbe glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband doesfor support and guidance in real time look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationshipsyou are not the first or only one and probably not the last woman who wants to leave an abusive partner  having guidance particular to you and your situation will help you move through what decisions to make as to how to leave this man,1,1,549
1099,i have been dating my boyfriend for eight years we met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when i met his family who treats him like he is their man they expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around and he thinks its okay,intimacy,well then you learned something new about your boyfriendare you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying togetherthink over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationshipthere are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationshipthe key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to livealso an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion   he may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you,1,1,556
1100,hes lied about his pastpresent situations since time has passed he has changed but i still have my doubts i have no idea if i should stay or go but i hate this feeling i dont trust him all too much but yet he hasnt done anything for me not to trust him recently,intimacy,your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him againotherwise how would you actually know whether hes lying to you now or notstart the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truthif he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past,1,1,533
1101,my fiancé of  years is always helping out his family and i feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness were about to get married this saturday but i feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids i am not enjoying our engagement at all,intimacy,congrats on your upcoming weddinghave you told the thoughts you write here to your fiancé this is the place to start since you clearly are unhappy with a part of his and now your life which will be with you for quite some time,1,1,226
1102,the eight months ive been dating my boyfriend i have lied about a lot of things i slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me now anything i say to him he wont believe even if im being honest i dont know what else to do at this point he constantly criticizes me,intimacy,start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trustask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you againif you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you then after a few months of this both of you should feel more secure in the relationship,1,1,388
1103,someone i care about told me im not teachable and im irritating i just want to be happy and wanted to please the person but i always fall short it seems,intimacy,pleasing someone certainly does feel satisfying  if the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfyingoffering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe heretell the person that you are trying to please them and also tell the person that their comments are hurtfulif the person said their words with no bad intentions then next time they comment its reasonable to expect these comments to not hurt your feelingskeep in mind that your good intentions may not be received in the way you intend them  some people sometimes are insensitive or just plain not interested in being pleased by another person,1,1,692
1104,ive been in a relationship for almost a year and i absolutely trust my boyfriend he treats me nice checks on me and tells me sweet things however when it comes to making life decisions i feel he is very immature i try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting as far as dates if i dont say anything plan it or have money to chip in we will not go i feel like i put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling and all i get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion,intimacy,well then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or notone point to keep in mind is thisjust because hes not telling you his opinions doesnt mean he doesnt have any opinionsin the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesnt tell you what is in their mindshort term it seems easy to have someone agreeablelong term someone who doesnt tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways,1,1,555
1105,my best friend and ive been really close for almost three years she lives in the uk and i live in the us ever since her boyfriend flew from oregon to scotland ive been angry at him ever since he came into her life he took her away from me my best friend would always say sorry and im sick of it,intimacy,you are definitely in a frustrating situationyour friend and the boyfriend are doing what is natural for couples who are in the early stage of their relationship  being almost inseparable to the point of overlooking friends is understandable as long as it doesnt continue for long enough that friends feel hurtif you feel you would like to one more time tell your friend that you miss your friendship with her and would like her attention then do soafter expressing your needs as much as possible and if the result doesnt change then the sad conclusion is that your friend is willing to give you less time and energy than you require from her,1,1,642
1106,i found the guy im dating on dating websites he was telling women that they were beautiful he said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked it has since happened two other times he says he loves me and im the only girl he wants to be with but i feel he is not telling me the truth,intimacy,i would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create for example you may want a relationship where honesty listening compassion and romanticism are major parts you could also see what your boyfriend wantsyou may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking openended questions not being answered with yes or no and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right after that perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking openended questionsremember that it takes two people to have  a relationship so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have,1,1,910
1107,my boyfriend wont touch me intimately he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me i know he has done this things with other women in the past i dont know why he wont do them with me what should i do,intimacy,ask himhaving a conversation about sexual satisfaction increases emotional intimacynot only will you potentially feel more deeply connected from a sincere conversation about your sexual questions maybe this increased emotional closeness will inspire the sexual closeness you wish to receive,1,1,290
1108,he said that if i were to visit my mother he will be gone when i get back my boyfriend and i hit a rough patch in our relationship a few months back and my mom had a few choice words with him,intimacy,your boyfriend and you have a separate relationship than your relationship with your mother   by trying to control whether or not you visit your mom unless you are in agreement with this is building tension between you and himask why he resents your interest to see your motherif he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward himif something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother,1,1,705
1109,my wife and i got separated because i asked about her contact with a male friend of hers the next day she kicked me out she let me move back two days later yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind i asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business,intimacy,when threats of leaving such as what you described in your question kicking you out wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship impacting both partners and if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship from the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship if your wife is willing i would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time or for you to talk with an individual therapist if marriage counseling isnt an option,1,1,827
1112,im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset,intimacy,imagine your best friend just told you that her husband lied to her all the time and that he had broken every promise he ever made to her what would you tell her if i were her best friend id tell her to run the other way you may love this man we dont choose who we love but the evidence is pretty clear isnt it a healthy relationship cannot be built on a foundation of lies and broken promises i believe that as adults we are always treated as well as we insist on being treated by our partners if you continue to accept unacceptable behavior you are likely to see lots more of it,1,1,580
1117,my fiancée is always letting me know how i am a horribleevil person or i just dont care enough when its about her feeling or when she is having an off day,intimacy,i dont know much about the dynamics of your relationship but i want to say that you cannot possibly be responsible for anyone elses happiness  if you are interested in a good read on this topic i highly recommend the four agreements by don miguel ruiz,1,1,251
1119,my fiancé and i recently had an argument over finances he gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance he no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy he realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why i was allowing him to continue to do that since i was physically paying it for him my response was that he was giving me the money and i just made the payment i didnt think of the coverages he was angry about it i still cant figure out that anger,intimacy,id be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per sewhat you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilitiesstart by withdrawing yourself from paying his billsif he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy then surely the only one for him to blame will be himselfstay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountabletell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you,1,1,677
1121,i believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem he masturbates daily even when i am lying in bed sleeping beside him we have sex once a week he is rough and worries about his needs he never touches me and treats me like a porn star wanting to finish on my face or chest,intimacy,the comments here from the other therapists are spot on as a certified sex addiction therapistcandidate im convinced your partners acting out creates trauma for you your partners addiction is not your fault and his recovery is his responsibility whats paramount is for you to get immediate help from an experienced therapist who understands trauma as result of the partnersspouses problematic sexual behaviors your needs safety and the establishment of reasonable boundaries is vital to your wellbeing i wish you the very bestresources for your consideration  httpswwwiitapcom  httpswwwsanonorg  httpwwwcosarecoveryorg,1,1,618
1124,we have been together over a year we spend time together every day no matter how busy he started to be unusually fatigued and losing weight he also began to be distant and sexually selfish we had a argument and he confided he has late stage stomach cancer he wont treat it,intimacy,i wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want wish for and desire from one another right now that doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wantsyou may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one anotheri would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends with him considering doing the same so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone elseit may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones,1,1,1172
1126,im in a relationship with my childs father im a really jealous person we dont go out or do anything with other people because of me to keep our relationship going i know i have to stop being jealous but i cant how can i get over these issues,intimacy,it may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than getting over it if youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous i dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your pastalso it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other at least to some degreealso consider what you may want from your childs father to assist you with this you cannot make him do anything to support you with this but you can certainly askwhat is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal,1,1,818
1127,im in my early s and ive been seeing my boyfriend for a year now my boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently he has made comments such as you would look better as a tumblr girl or you should start doing more squats its really hurtful,intimacy,my first thought was that i wondered what changed recently is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that oneits possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts youtry asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important i dont know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly then you can listen to his side of the concern,1,1,599
1128,my girlfriend remains friends with ex boyfriendslovers on facebook who actively like and comment on posts it causes me to get jealous because im afraid they might reconnect somehow ive attempted to talk to her about it but she avoids it and doesnt seem to worry about how i feel about it,intimacy,talking about it would probably be helpful if youre both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important it may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time you can adjust the timing for what works for both of you after one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say this can lessen confusioni know you say that she avoids it it might be a good place to start talking about it  to see what makes her avoid it it could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cant talk to them i dont know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well,1,1,919
1129,she works with a man and always looks at guys that check her out,intimacy,i wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about this can often change the way that we look at different situations try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings beforeif you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you then you could talk about feelings that youre having,1,1,574
1130,my boyfriend and i have been going out for about a year i suddenly find myself jealous when i see him talking to other girls i have never been this way before i dont like these feelings he said that my jealousy would cause our relationship to have problems i told him i cant help these feelings i dont know where they are coming from but this is how i feel i tried to stop but i cant i really like this guy but im afraid that im messing up the relationship its just stupid,intimacy,trust is at the top of what makes a healthy relationship  it sounds like you may benefit from personal counseling to explore where this jealousy comes from and what keeps you from having complete trust in your boyfriend  this is not stupid this is your mind telling you that there is something that needs to be worked through  sometimes we need to talk to someone like a counselor who is disconnected from our life to understand our feelings and what they mean in our relationships,1,1,481
1131,weve been dating for two months now i have a heavy past that gets him angry does he have a right to penalize me for things i did before i met him,intimacy,not in my book youre only two months in at this early stage this is a bit of a warning sign if he cant accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions youve made theres already a level of discomfort here that shouldnt be ignored no he doesnt have the right to penalize you or punish you not just for past thingsnot for anything what he does get to do it tell you how it affects him sureif he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurancelisten to those things but if he doesnt dig who you are maybe he can walk the other way,1,1,529
1133,my husband and i are in our s weve been married  years three weeks ago he said he loves me but is not in love with me he was going to leave me but he said he thought about it and decided to stay i dont know how to feel any more how should i take what he said and not feel so hurt he has been very blunt and hurtful words just come out of his mouth he makes me feel like im nothing but i so dearly love him with everything in me he said it wasnt a midlife crisis,intimacy,i get it your husband tells you that hes not in love with you but oops hes changed his mind and will tolerate you for a while longer excuse me my dear its okay if you expect more than that from a marriage maybe the question has shifted from whether he is happy in the marriage to whether you are happy in the marriage you say you love this man  who makes you feel like nothing i say it might be time to sit down with an individual therapist and look objectively at your marriage and whether its working for you,1,1,510
1134,there are intimate things she did early in the relationship and things she had once agreed to try that she will not do now i end up thinking about it all day i feel rejected and think i married the wrong person,intimacy,id say youre letting fear get a hold on you you would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasnt initiated in a long while but its a big leap to go from that to i married the wrong person fear is telling you that she doesnt respect or like or want you look at the bigger picture what is the evidence that your wife wants to please youthat she is the right woman for youthat she loves youthat she cares about whats important to you  if there is evidence there then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughtstalking to your wife is so important right now we all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enoughbut they cant read our minds can you lovingly let her know what you miss what you hope forwhat you need this is the meat of a loving relationship sharing who we are so that we can love each other better your wife deserves the benefit of the doubt that shell listen to what you long for can you risk feeling vulnerable you cant control her answer but can you trust her to care,1,1,1115
1135,i am a female and i am afraid of having sex i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced i think he thinks im not a virgin i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex,intimacy,these fears are completely normal almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience men also feel far more of these fears than you realize that can helpto remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approvalyou mention a partner but im not sure if you currently have one having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important when youre really confident someone cares deeply for you this can help the fears to go away or diminish how well do you know your own body getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feelgetting acquainted with your body yourself firstthis can help build sexual confidence in general our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear asideironically this is what makes you good in bed but be patient with yourself your confidence will grow with experience and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready theres not rush ,1,1,1082
1138,i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like,intimacy,i dont think theres anything that youre supposed to feel some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all it could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions when something we do is hiddena secretits easier to avoid feeling guilty i wonder if youre avoiding your own emotions but lets put that question aside for now there are better questionswhat do you want do you want your marriage if not this may be why you dont feel guilty do you want to be able to sleep with your friend its unlikely that both are possible keeping the marriage and the affair yes you get to do whatever you want with your bodyandthere may be consequences affairs almost always get discovered who do you want to be what kind of partner do you want to be what might your partner feel if they knew how might you feel then would you care has something happened thats affected how much you care about your partneri suggest that these other questions might be a place to start exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe i wish you the best as you sort it out ,1,1,1138
1140,as i was growing up my mother and father always fought with that i grew trust issues i think its going to affect my relationship now and end it sooner then i want to i try not to let it affect me but i cant,intimacy,if you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship  dont allow their problems to become your problem  you didnt mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them  like in the court of law if no evidencefind not guilty  dont make them pay the consequences as if guilty of your parents unhealthy behavior,1,1,457
1141,he owns his own business sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me we have a son together and i get to stay home with him he says i complain too much about what hes doing weve been together a year and a half i got pregnant after being together for a month we moved in together when i had my son in july everything was great and then he started the staying out he then started not spending time with either of us i just dont know if im doing something wrong weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before,intimacy,congrats on the birth of your sonyour situation sounds painful lonely and isolatingand these features are eating away at your selfconfidencestart by believing in yourself  the feelings and ideas you describe here would only be arising from within you because they are at the very least partly trueask your boyfriend if he is willing to listen and understand your point of view  if he does then hopefully the two of you will more easily talk with one another about the truth of feeling overwhelmed by the quick pace of your courtship and becoming a familyif these discussions continuously include him blaming you for having your own feelings and expecting him to more actively be a part of your and your sons life then youll need to start valuing your feelings and what is best for you and your son by yourselfi send you lots of good luck,1,1,837
1143,i love him so much and i dont know what to do,intimacy,hi savannah this is a pretty common issue one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving yet their partner doesnt feel loved theres a great book the five love languages by gary chapman he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we dont necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner you might feel that by going out to work and earn money youre being loving but if your partners main love language is quality time youre not hitting that bulls eye because youre not home the five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch i recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partners language a bit better you may never be fluent but you can get better the most important part is to understand each other better and to know that theres nothing wrong with either of you youre just speaking different languages you can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved i bet he just needs you to speak his language  ,1,1,1144
1144,my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore,intimacy,your situation sounds a little painfulhave you brought up any of these topics for discussion with your fiancénow is a good time for finding out if and how your future husband is interested and addresses the way you are feelinguntil the two of you open up what bothers you all you or anyone who talks to you about the situation can do is take guesses as to what is driving your finances behaviorsalso in the moment of when your fiancé texts you words you find surprising or startling you can tell him this   maybe by being clear and truthful about how what he writes affects you then next time he will change what he tells youand if he doesnt then you know that you explained yourself he had this information about you and that  he isnt that willing to consider what you told him really the best first step is to open up all the topics you wrote about here with him  this way youll give each of you to discuss how to care about one another in a meaningful way,1,1,958
1145,im in love with my friend who is also a girl i fell in love with her in a few months that was my first love we used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on facebook i thought she had the same feelings for me but i was wrong i always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life but all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy ive tried to be in relationship with guys but i cant be in love with them,intimacy,it all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is  you may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real this is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person time will tell but if you need to discuss this you could see your school councelor if you are at schooluniversity or find a lgbt group with meetings and discuss this with them i hope this is helpful,1,1,552
1146,ive been getting told lately by my partner that its embarrassing that im so antisocial around his family and friends i believe its because im not as social as him,intimacy,hi buffalo i think youre right your partners reactions are about him i have to say its a cruel thing to say to someone you lovethat youre embarrassed by them the subtext says youre not good enough and i love that you can reject that false messageyou dont have to be different for anyone if he cant accept you for who you are what is he doing with you your social habits unless they are extremelike you refuse to go anywhere arent a reflection on him its just you being you also and im sure youve found thisthe more he judges you the more difficult it is for you to be the confident outgoing person he wants you to beso his method of trying to change you doesnt even worki think thats the cruxhes trying to change you what does that make you want to do,1,1,751
1147,my partner and i have had an amazing relationship and connection for over two years were very committed to each other and are planning a very long life together however he recently was very open and honest that he isnt interested in having sex with me anymore he says this has happened in every past relationships and has ended it as a result he knows its because its the same person feeling but how can he get over this,intimacy,i wonder how long anymore will be for your boyfriendsince you both are planning a long life together instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committedwhat are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationshipknowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like,1,1,491
1148,we got into arguments and we would break if off but start it back up again we clicked or so i thought we are both married with problems in our marriage we never have sex we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together his wife found out and he lied to her and didnt even refer to it as an affair i cant stop thinking about him we just click ive been married for  years and ive never liked anyone other than my husband now i like him and well never be together,intimacy,if you will never be together and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved there is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible then maybe you want something else for your life  if you and your husband are willing i would encourage you to do some therapy or counselling together  you may enjoy this article to learn a little more about some factors that lead to connection or disconnection and that predict separation and divorce,1,1,738
1149,my boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me and i believe it it has been one of the best relationships i have been in for a short period of time but he has lied to me so much hell tell me that hell stop lying and while hes saying that hes hiding something or lying about something first it was about a girl he hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in next was his exgirlfriend he put a fake contact name and it was just friendly but he lied to my face all the time he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better,intimacy,new york new yorkits not your boyfriends lying that concerns me the most its the lies you tell yourself verbal expressions are easy but its walking the walk thats more important in the end when someone shows you what theyre capable of you can believe them hes capable of being manipulative and deceitful and he even lies as hes telling you hell stop lying what youre doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence he might love you with his heart but love in the end is a verb and is based on respectful loving behaviours my wish is that you start by believing in what you deserve,1,1,634
1150,about a month ago i went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his exgirlfriend that he was dating before me he gave her a promise ring when they were together and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room i found many things on his phone but that broke my heart the most he deleted all the messages but two i cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that it really kills me and i cant stop thinking about it,intimacy,your sense of hurt is very understandabledo you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phonesi ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationshipprobably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the otherwith this new level of clarity his  past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little,1,1,711
1151,i have been married for  years he and i both cheated i hid my cheating for  years over that time i let life stress me out i became depressed when i finally woke up he felt i had pushed him out,intimacy,do you both want to fix the marriagethe relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too will have one person who does all the changingthis dynamic itself creates problems of its ownabout your husband telling you he feels pushed out did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like thisall you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt likeif he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you is okbecause affairs create mistrust between two people the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each others trusttalking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other how you each are feeling what matters to you is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriages future,1,1,888
1152,my boyfriend recently got a kitty i hate cats in general and he knows it it grosses me out and makes me very upset when he pets his cat i want to throw out the cat i feel very jealous,intimacy,sorry for you and sorry for the cat because youre each in a tense positionwhat was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with youif you dont already know his answer then find out  doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you  does he expect you to accept without question whatever he does  does he care about your views  does a cat have some deep meaning for him that having one is essential to his life and he never told you soplease dont be mean to the cat  its not the cats fault for being in your boyfriends carethere are plenty of other cats on this earth so throwing out the cat will not solve anything between you and your boyfriendwho knows your boyfriend may come back home with three more catsstart with a conversation about your feelings and his interest in your feelings,1,1,895
1153,i have no idea what happened i go places and do things but still feel lonely i honestly have no friends and i am always the one texting people and bothering people i feel invisible like someone that no one wants to be around,intimacy,a lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situationsis it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your lifeif yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choiceat the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you firstalso most relationships are not forever  is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity,1,1,845
1154,i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration i hate it i dont know why but i just want it to be over i feel like crying i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it,intimacy,does your boyfriend notice that you hate sexif yes then it is a topic which the two of you would gain deeper understanding of each other by discussingif no then possibly one reason for hating sex is that your boyfriend doesnt notice who you are as a person not simply a physical body engaged in sex,1,1,298
1155,i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust,intimacy,hello being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her if so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back couples counseling would be of benefit if not then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from there are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them the issue is not likely to get resolved in the meantime i suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship hope it all works out for you both,1,1,957
1157,ive been in a relationship for over a year hes cheated and lied i heard hes married but he says hes not everything is very up and down theres no trust recently he went on a trip and i promised him id behave and not drink because when i drink i drink too much and i tend to make poor choices this time i made a huge mistake i drank too much and i cheated on him i slept with another man for about five minutes before realizing what i was doing is wrong i told him and he just got really rude he called me names and threatened me i feel bad as i do love him we just have so many issues im not a bad person ive just made a lot of bad mistakes its unintentional and i know right from wrong but why do i still make the wrong choice,intimacy,hi calgary canada  let me get this straightyoure in a relationship but he might be married you both cheat and lie and hes abusive the short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it relationships dont heal us and they dont help us grow up we have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before its going to work id recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while you have a lot to sort out i wish you the best,1,1,457
1158,"ive been with my husband for eight years now we have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated i took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes however we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust my insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again during that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child
   the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life
   im of course hurt and in shock i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go my heart will still be torn apart i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought",intimacy,hi jayuya im struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cant do that and i dont think either of those things will help you id like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe do you have supports do your family and friends know whats happening in your life have you ever been to a womens shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly thats what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best,1,1,1185
1159,i just got married with my husband i have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past i know all marriages have problems but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust its hard for me to let go because i love him but i am getting tired,intimacy,hi louisianayou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshiptrust is the first stage in a relationship moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element but you didnt see this coming did you thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface i give you credit for wanting it to work and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust good luck,1,1,779
1160,my boyfriend and i have not had sex in a couple of weeks he had to have a cyst removed on his testicles i have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him im scared to touch him and get close to him because im afraid that i will hurt him,intimacy,are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex againbeing able to talk together about topics that involve both of you will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional levelalso there are many ways of making love  if your bfs cyst hasnt yet healed then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions is to read about these together with himi hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another while developing more emotional closeness in the process,1,1,578
1161,my husband always works he does work from home but his hours are from morning until night and he neglects his family if i have anything i want to do i have to find a babysitter but he does what he wants he rarely comes to bed when i do and we never have date nights,intimacy,hi ohio the crazy things about situations like this is that almost guaranteed while your husband is out working and away from home he feels hes doing it all for you and the kids he believes hes loving you he might feel like hes carrying his family on his shoulders your love language is differentyoud rather spend time with him or talk to himyou want to feel like hes a bigger part of the family and feel connected to him i absolutely understand that and i support you asking for thathe might very well miss that feeling of connectedness too but hes likely also feeling the weight of financial responsibility a lot of men and women dont talk about this but they feel it sometimes they feel like they cant win either way theres pressure to earn and pressure to be home he has needs too he probably wants more appreciation and less blame i urge you to talk to him about how you feel find out how hes feeling and use a professional to assist you if your communication styles arent great right now you want to spend time with him and that tells me that you have a good chance of addressing this problem successfully,1,1,1111
1162,how do i stop those thoughts,intimacy,the thoughts you are having are just thoughts  not actions  it is your choice whether you act on these thoughts  if you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great  if you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts you may want to see a cognitivebehavioural therapist  take care,1,1,311
1163,im a  year old male and having erection problems still have the desire for a woman awfully frustrated any suggestions my doc doesnt want to discuss it,intimacy,when a doc blows you off it may be a signal that it is time to find a new one ed can often be caused by health issues if all physical possibilities are ruled out then its time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist heres a good article for you to start with,1,1,272
1165,my wife and i are newly married about  months weve had some issues surrounding sex particularly her lack of libido shes on an anxiety medication of which diminished libido is a side effect but i think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacyromance centered around my hectic schedule our sex life has suffered as a result tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex which is a big deal once things started she had the most obviously fake orgasm ive ever encountered i was honest with her about why and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it she responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking i dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation i think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further please help,intimacy,you are newly married you have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication what if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another you know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  it turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments and have fun with it,1,1,573
1166,we make love once per month is it normal,intimacy,to begin with whats normal for one couple isnt going to be normal for the next every couple has their own normal and thats important to keep in mind your sexual lives will ebb and flow what id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having id also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it here,1,1,440
1167,when having sex i think of other men and want other men all day long been married  years together  what do you think,intimacy,sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be it sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together thats both common and confusing intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow resparking your passion will involve growing using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs security and wants desires marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required,1,1,624
1168,i have this weird fetish that im afraid to open up about it what should i do,intimacy,this is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is  i do understand that this is something that is bothering you though the first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not  if this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urgeshowever if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings  you may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of  you may find other people have the same interest as you  find a therapist that you can trust and tell them  dont hold back with your therapist  trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are  there is no need to suffer with this alone,1,1,943
1169,i just lost my grandpa and im having a rough time with it    i need some help to deal with the loss but i dont think i can pay for counseling where can i get help,griefandloss,im sorry your grandpa diedgood for you to write on this site about wanting help to know how best to live with this new losshave you looked online for blogs and forums about adjusting to a recent death  that you know youd like another person to help you adjust is a good sign of your own mental health stabilityit is possible that reading online blogs and discussion forums writing on these if you feel like doing so and possibly joining a local free support group will be all you need to feel betterthere is no set timeline in grief   let yourself take as much time as you feel is best for you,1,1,593
1182,my grandma and brother both passed away  years ago and sometimes at night i just cant stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but wont have ever again i cant sleep at night when the memories and tears come ill be fine all day then at nightboom its like waterfalls from my eyes why cant i stop crying,griefandloss,its good to know you are reminiscing about good memories  the sadness and crying is normal when you are missing a loved one  you are noticing that grief changes it doesnt just stop  you have recognized that there will be moments in life that you will want to have shared with your brother and grandma and it just seems unfair that you cannot  i often find that when someone is stuck in the place you are it is a result of unfinished business and in your case it appears unfinished futures  a professional versed in grieving and its intricacies can guide you to navigate through this and lessen the intensity that you experience  as life goes on there will be many moments that you will have wished they were present but those moments do not have to bring you such intense emotion  seek some help you wont regret it,1,1,814
1184,last year i just always felt hopeless i dont have a great relationship with my sister i lost my mother recently and that really added to my sadness my sister always brings up how i was never close to my mother,griefandloss,wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationshipswhat they could have been never were and what was lost with death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while or longer i hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your moms passing i also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time as long as you need to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister,1,1,572
1185,the past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present everything about whats gone feels so amazing almost like im high off nostalgia but in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories and a close friend that left me are gone forever how do i move past that and live more in the present,griefandloss,do some selfreflecting as to what areas of your life youd currently like to developthe good news is you know how happiness feelsthat you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life,1,1,318
1186,i loved him more than anything he passed away on our anniversary which was also the day i was going to apply for our apartment im not handling it well i moved to a new town and started a new life but nothing helps,griefandloss,i am so sorry to hear of your boyfriends passing grief is something that can take a long time to recover from have you considered speaking with a grief counselor being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly this is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward in the mean time immerse yourself with positivity ie good friends hobbies exercise and try to schedule a time with a counselor perhaps there will be a support group you could also join oftentimes it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as yougood luck to you i hope you will find peace and comfort soon,1,1,729
1187,"my brother has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and has not been taking his medication hes been using methamphetamine and alcohol and was found sleeping naked in my step mom driveway in  degree weather
   i was adopted in by his dad who just passed and his mother will not get involved because shes afraid of financial responsibility    do i have the rights to be able to sign my brother into mentalhealth facility",substanceabuse,im sorry to hear that your brother has been having such a rough time hes lucky to have you on his side although he may not always see it that wayas far as whether you can sign him in that depends on a lot of different thingsi would suggest that you google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to crisis hotline they can tell you how it works in that county my guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment but i cant  be entirely sure you could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility i have not heard of that being a problem but i guess it would depend on insuranceif you have trouble finding a local  hotline consider calling the national crisis number  and ask them to help you find someone local,1,1,805
1190,"im planning to have baby so i have to quit smoking  but its hard sometimes its not a physical need its mental
   i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substanceabuse,when trying to quit an addiction it is imperative to decide what purpose the addiction serves you said it is not a physical need but rather a mental need what other ways could this need be alleviated  a video i  often recommend to those who want to quit a habit is  addiction ,1,1,276
1196,im a female in my mid s lately i tend to over drink and ive become a very angry drunk    in the past i have even cheated on my boyfriend while i was under the influence of alcohol    but now even if i dont do anything wrong and dont embarrass myself i still feel really guilty after a night of drinking i dont understand why im feeling this way does this mean i have a problem,substanceabuse,maybe this will help you understand  first it depends on many chemical factors  when you drink alcohol overindulge so to speak  you are flooding the pre frontal cortex of your brain  this controls communication and cognitive behavior  there were studies on this and many times if you notice those intoxicated get loud respond to loudness  also certain types of alcohol can have sides effects  instead of brown liquor try white liquor  experiment safely to find if you maybe having side effects causing overindulgence which we dont want to lead to alcoholism   set an intention before experimenting that you will not feel angry or guilty seek talk therapy which will help decrease the cravings or desire to,1,1,705
1202,shes my stepmom im pretty sure shes illegally buying the drugs and hiding them from my dad,substanceabuse,are the drugs themselves illegal or the method of her purchasing themhow do you know the facts of what you write herealso are you sure your stepmom is buying or hiding them for her own use and not on behalf of your fatherif youd like to lovingly make your father aware of your findings then be clear on these answers since most likely hell want to know this informationif the drugs are illegal and in his house then he is just as liable for arrest as the stepmomim sure from this perspective at least hed appreciate your telling him of your findings,1,1,549
1204,or how to send him somewhere that can help him something like the baker act,substanceabuse,your dad needs to be aware that he has a problem and be willing to make some changes in order for him to be motivated to stop  often times individuals will be forced to stop when they were not ready  remember we can not ever make someone do something they do not want to do  there needs to be at least a little willingness on the other party to make some changes  i would encourage you to reach out to your family or other loved ones and have a conversation with your dad regarding your concerns,1,1,495
1205,my boyfriend and i recently broke up one week we were fine and the next he told me he needed space he completely deleted me out of his life he does have an opiate addiction he claimed he was sober but since weve split ive heard many lies from him could he be using again and does this addiction affect the mind,substanceabuse,studies have proven that addiction affects the brain there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well  i would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns  not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals  being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationships,1,1,463
1206,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,substanceabuse,your friend needs to admit they have a problem  if not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more  it is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested  in other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them  like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways  i would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation  encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her,1,1,634
1208,my brother has been a heroin addict for years and hes now in his mids he has taken from me my mom and my grandparents hes sick in the head now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us today my mom and my brother went toetotoe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high i ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my moms face i feel terrible but hes always picking his girlfriend over us mind you he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend hes single and shes only living here because he feels bad we tried kicking them out and everything but nothing is working they do nothing to try and help,substanceabuse,i think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation  it can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted  it is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself  other individuals need to take the same accountability  enabling often happens in households with addiction it can be a challenging environment to live in,1,1,413
1209,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,substanceabuse,you may feel hopeless but you are not hopeless addictions of any sort are difficult to overcome especially when they serve to bury pain and suffering that one is experiencing it is not impossible to overcome alcohol or drug useabusedependence on your own but you will likely find much greater success with the help of a therapist or other support system such as rehabilitation or alcoholics anonymous i suggest doing a bit of research to see what type of help is available and feasible for you in your area and go from there know that recovery takes time willingness and effort dont give up and remember that you are not hopeless you can make the choice to change your habits and learn new ways of healthy coping best of luck to you,1,1,732

1253,i have been dating my exboyfriends cousin for a few years we have gotten pretty serious he wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex,familyconflict,does your boyfriend agree with the other peoples opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he doesnt like hearingtalk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering himonce the two of you understand what if any the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status youll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow,1,1,514
1254,my mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though im in my s she argues with me over stupid stuff,familyconflict,this sounds like a pretty difficult dynamic and i am sorry to hear how it is impacting youi would encourage you to try and observe the relationship from an outside perspective to begin with  try to see what it is that causes your mom to be upset such as you responding in a tone of voice she doesnt like and see if there is something you could change on your end  if you are able to change something like your tone of voice start there  you could also try asking what you could do to help perhaps she is frustrated that the trash wasnt taken out  you could also sit down and try to hash things out with her if you feel like that could be beneficialultimately you are only in charge of you  the things you say your behaviors are all controlled by you  so it is important to recognize that no matter what you cant control what she says or does  obviously the things we say or do can impact others which is why you are frustrated over her behavior  but remember that you are able to only control yourself  seeking therapeutic intervention could also be beneficial for you and even having her join in to help  i hope you are able to figure something out and i wish you well,1,1,1169

1256,"my wife and mother are having tense disagreements in the past theyve had minor differences for example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy
 however its intensified lately i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements what can i do",familyconflict,one choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your motherfrom what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your motheronce the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happenthis is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points your mother will disagree and have different viewsthese need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with,1,1,736
1257,it was over  years ago but the pain has resurfaced again now because i have started seeing her facebook posts about how great her life is i feel so angry how can i handle this,familyconflict,first thing that you must realize is that most people only post the best parts of their lives on facebook some people even go so far as to make their lives seem better or more interesting and post mostly false views of their life facebook is watered down candied version of our life you put on there only what you want people to see the questions you should ask is how have i grown from this is my marriage currently in a good place i really wish there was some form of magic that could be performed to solve peoples issues and help them sort out their emotions and troubles however there is not the closest we can get is by using time and insight to heal our wounds,1,1,666
1261,my mom and dad got divorced four years ago i had to finish out the school year with my dad and now they are deciding which place is best for me i cant choose how can i choose if i love both places,familyconflict,if youve already stated to your parents that youd like your opinion to be considered and listed the key areas youd like them to keep in mind when making a final decision as to which house you will live then youve done all you possibly and reasonably can dosince you wrote that you have difficulty to decide in which parents home you prefer to live then even if you had free choice of whose house in which to live are you not better off with the decision made by them on your behalf,1,1,481
1263,i have known i was always different this year in december i found out that i never felt female i did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad,familyconflict,in part the answer depends on your ageif you are legally a minor then consulting with a doctor for guidance on transitioning will require your father or whoever else pays for your health insurancethe way to tell him if it is a necessity and even if you are older and would like him to know your truth is as followsknow the reason for your hesitancy to speak with himthis  way you can anticipate and to some degree rehearse your answerstell him the truth about your own difficulty to speak about the topic  people usually soften if they feel you appeal to their compassion and sensitivityalso accept that you may hear a bad reaction from him and be prepared for this possibility,1,1,677

1265,they broke up recently she was a huge part of my life,familyconflict,the possible pathways for you depend on whether youd be wiling to be straightforward with both your mom and her gf about your own emotions about their breakupstart by talking with your mom because she has the more potent and the more long term relationship meaning in your lifeopen the conversation as your genuine need for a positive settlement to the end of their relationshipdepending on the outcome of the talk with your mom come to your own conclusion as to whether youd like to find ways to maintain some level of connection to the ex gfholiday and birthday cards occasional emails with the person may feel supportive for youonce you have some idea of your preferences for contact or not and what type then speak with the ex gf to find out her reaction to how open she is to your remediesat the very least you will have done a thorough job in examining what is possible for your own relationship with each one,1,1,915

1273,im a teenager my entire family needs family therapy and more than likely individual therapy my parents refuse to take action and im tired of it is there any way i can get out of this myself,familyconflict,this sounds like a really tough situation  as a teenager you may be able to get counseling on your own without needing your parents consent under some circumstances  if your parents are refusing to consider counseling you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adult about finding some counseling resources  even without your parents help,1,1,359
1274,its the way my mom said i was worth nothing stupid no point of being in school im lazy little fat,familyconflict,your mom is telling you cruel wordsthe fact that she is your mother and is not supportive and willing to point out your strengths is a good reason to not believe what she tells youparents are meant to nurture their children not take them down with wordskids go to summer schmo for all sorts of reasons  if you were unable to concentrate during the school year on academic subjects for whatever reason summer school is a way to catch up so you will stay with your classmates in the school year which starts in septemberi understand not liking the idea of school in the summer  only this is different than being putdown the way your mother does to you,1,1,649

1276,for the past week or so me and my boyfriend have been fighting he has been making a lot of bad choices and he is currently hospitalized im barely eating or sleeping because im constantly worried about him everyone else in my life says that i should just forget about him and walk away what should i do,familyconflict,forgetting ones emotions is impossiblesince you are in a relationship with this guy your emotions keep your feelings active toward himdoes he respect your upset with his lifestyle choicesare the two of you having conversations about your opinions on himyoure as entitled to dislike what he does as he is to like what he doessince youre together in a relationship respect for the others values and how best to live life mattershe may be as unhappy about your dislike for his lifestyle as you are with histry to know whether hes willing to change to accommodate youstudy whether youre willing to change to accept his wayssee whether the two sides are close enough to be different from one another and still be happy togetherthen if the answer is no you can consider to separate from him and your emotions gradually will recuperate from leaving the relationship,1,1,858
1277,ever since my mother passed away my family has treated me like a stranger now im concerned that my father will need to go into a nursing home if that happens i think im going to be on my own to handle it    what should i do im going to need my familys help and support,familyconflict,understandably youd like support from those who know and love youfrom what you write your family members do not offer you your very reasonable expectationstart by telling particular family members with whom you feel youd have the most likely chance of success in their meeting your expectation by loving youthis way you are able to tell yourself youve tried what is reasonable to trydont give up on expecting loving support for yourselfif your family members are unwilling to give you this then start to give yourself loving attention and caregradually you will bring yourself in contact with new others who will love youloving yourself makes you attractive so others will find your willingness to be loved,1,1,706
1278,we just cannot seem to get along i cannot have a conversation with her without it turning into world war  she treats me like i have no right to an opinion and never really lets me speak my real mother cares and tries to help me but she cant do much because my adoptive mother wont listen to her either,familyconflict,going to see a experience counselor would be my advice  you will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding  if she doesnt agree to counseling really the only person you can change is you  i would suggest that you approach her with love and let her know what you appreciate about her let her know the great things she have done that could not be replaced or forgotten however you want your relationship to get better than it has been lately  hopefully this will open the door of communication where you can explain your thoughts and feeling but in a loving way,1,1,624

   i get so depressed because of my dads yelling he keeps asking me why i cant just be happy the way i am and yells at me on a daily basis is this considered emotional abuse",familyconflict,maybe this is emotional abuseit certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourselfmaybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your gendertheres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this  only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him,1,1,503
1280,"how do i ever trust another woman i have found myself constantly reading between the lines with every other woman that i meet i am having a difficult time making any sort of connection to anyone because of her deception and willingness to say and do literally anything in order to control my emotions
 once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application",familyconflict,im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wifeon the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful timemaybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for exampleconsider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person   your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behaviortheres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventurestheres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again  the first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship   there is no designated time line  youll simply feel more ready than you feel nowvery unlikely that youd ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one youre currently recovering fromgood luck,1,1,995
1282,i have three siblings my mom loves them and not me shes always yelling at me but when it comes to my siblings she talks to them im always crying in my room,familyconflict,have you ever tried talking with her about this when shes not angry while i hear you saying that it feels like she doesnt love you there could be a lot of other pieces to this have you ever told her about how much she means to you when shes not angry,1,1,250
1283,my stepdad and i always mess around ive noticed that whenever he playfully hits me its always my butt that he hits he always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when i walk into a room im a teenager female and i want to know if this is normal,familyconflict,its hard to tell from the way you described it do you think he would be open to an honest discussion it could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter as far as scanning you from head to toe i can think of reasons that parents might do that i also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are that way it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are,1,1,595
1284,any time my family and friends are in an altercation im the one who steps in im the one they call to fight for them i do this even though i have a tough time trusting the people im fighting for im only in my early s,familyconflict,you could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting a lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain for other people conflict is just hard to watch andor listen toas for having a tough time trusting them that could also relate to past events between you and these other people or it could relate to the conflict that you mentioned it can be difficult to trust someone deeply when you dont know when the next big fight or argument is going to startthe next time you step in for someone consider asking yourself what is making you do that what are you feeling in the moment,1,1,675
1286,she has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and im her caregiver all she does is complain hit me call me names and say things happened that didnt when i tell her she explodes i didnt always hate her but now every little thing she does irritates me and i dont have the means to live on my own,familyconflict,it sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating hersomething you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom i dont know how old your mom is but if she is younger they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help if you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together do you think your mom is able to actually recognize how what she does and says affects youfrom whom do you have support during all of this,1,1,703
1287,im in my midtwenties now and my boyfriend of seven years and i want to start a life my mother is  codependent on me and is extremely manipulative she suffers from type  diabetes which she uses to guilt me if i ever leave her the problem is that i will feel guilty,familyconflict,focus more on your own life and less on the very heavy descriptors you wrote to describe your momall the words you wrote represent psychological conditions which are either lifelong or take a lot of motivation and effort to changesince the only person who can change how your mom handles her life is your mom and you are the only one who can do the same for yourself devote more energy and time to living your own life fully despite the emotions you feel regarding her,1,1,468
1288,my mother and i have an okay relationship i know she loves me unconditionally and i love her the same however more times than not im afraid to tell her anything personal because she either doesnt listen she turns it around and makes everything about her or she ignores things  even when they are about my mental health,familyconflict,could you tell her   what would happen if you said mom i love you and i really want to share myself with you but often i you get upset and i dont want that to happen i really want to be able to talk to you,1,1,205
1289,it happens especially at me and my sister and then she gets emotional and brings up the past how should i deal with it she is always stressed about her work and doesnt put her family first,familyconflict,you are very wise for a young person you have already figured out that other peoples behaviourshow they treat youits not about youits about them i love that you dont blame yourself for your moms behaviours its not your fault shes getting upset because she doesnt know how to manage her emotions and these emotions have to do with her past and her present stress youre just the trigger yes this is normal but its not necessary she can find another way to manage her stuffunfortunately you cant help your mom a whole lot or even help her recognize this but for yourself remembering that her behaviours are her issue is the biggest piece of dealing with it you can always try some new strategies when you talk to momyou can say ill listen you better if you dont bring up past stuff or im worried about you mom you seem stressed or even i dont like the way you talk to me good luck,1,1,877
1291,my parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay when they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual i dont know if i am ready to come out to them,familyconflict,coming out to family members can cause a lot of anxiety however  although i cannot promise what their reaction will be the benefit is that you will no longer have to hide who you are perhaps researching or getting information on bisexuality can help your family understand what it truly is to be bisexual many times  people are just not educated on certain things,1,1,363
1293,i saw my mother cheating on my dad before i said something to her and she said it was in the past yesterday i saw her texting dirty things to the same guy should i talk to her again i dont want my parents to go their separate ways i just want her to stop its not fair,familyconflict,you as the child in the middle of your parents problems is the worse position to be in  i can only imagine your hurt pain and confusion on what to do  honestly this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age your parents ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end  one thing i would like to noteyour parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating they have already gone their separate ways,1,1,476
1294,she is living with her boyfriend of seven years he is in therapy for depression and social anxiety he hasnt worked in all this time,familyconflict,congrats on your upcoming grandchilddoes your daughter want you to break news of her pregnancy to the familytalk with your daughter first whether or not she would like you to tell other family membersalso given the other facts you mention in your post if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable then bring up these topics toostay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours,1,1,447
1295,i keep being mean to my best friend and i dont know why all the time i did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time could that be a cause,familyconflict,hi morristowntheres a saying that goes hurt people hurt people its possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mothers behaviours when we are treated poorly especially as children it affects how we ourselves others and the world its also powerful modelling of aggressive behaviour the good news is that you have this lovely awareness and i think a desire to learn about yourself and grow in your ability to be respectful to people you care about i recommend you consider sitting down with a therapist and exploring these ideas and moving forward on that path you seem to want to be on good luck,1,1,622
1296,my mom and i have been fighting a lot now and i just want a good relationship with her,familyconflict,the best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively  one of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response  often the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication the hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times,1,1,834
1297,i am a teenager and my brother is a few years older he has a girlfriend who is always with him he never hangs out with me anymore we were really close and it is making me really sad,familyconflict,hi zionsville its so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother you will always have that you know hes doing whats natural at his agespreading his wings and looking for love you may be heading into that zone soon too but i get that its weird that hes there before you and you miss himtry to respect your brothers autonomy wish him well be friendly with his girlfriend and its also okay to say hey bro im still here when can we hang out,1,1,453
1299,hello i have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled insecure and frustrated during her stay here in the city i know she comes from a place of love but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate negative oblivious and self consumed    i have tried to talk to her openly about this but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful spatially aware of surroundingspeople or positive but in the end i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship    what can i do,familyconflict,do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does if they dont see these qualities in you then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you you can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are its her issue and she is not coming from a place of loveeven if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love the fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you,1,1,743
1301,i use to be so happy no matter what i always was happy i got into a relationship with this guy i love him so much were both teenagers the week after his birthday my mom made me stop talking to him it broke me he came to my house and talked to her and she let us date again but not see each other he comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that i have to lie to her,familyconflict,i understand that this can be difficult when you care about someone have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other and what her concerns are it sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating and compromising it is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having  to lie to your mom it  would be helpful if she could understand that you having to lie to he is getting in the way of you being able to go to her with any issue and  feel she will hopefully understand or try to understand where you are coming from  have either one of you been in family therapy this may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from if your mood is sad and your feeling worse it is important that you reach out to an adult parent person at school whom you trust to share your feelings and help you feel understood and work through your problems,1,1,986
1302,im applying to private high schools im playing basketball on my school team currently and i love it i also play on a team that ive hated since the beginning and i finally want to quit before the season gets started however my parents say i can play on either both teams or neither i think its unfair because its up to me if i want to play for a certain team i was planning on playing basketball for the high school i get into but if that means continuing to play for the team i hate then i wouldnt want to play in high school now i dont know what to do my parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if i dont play i just want to run away,familyconflict,the situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on youare you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standardare your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hateif yes then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiateif none of the above is possible then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist whom youd trust and feel safe in talkingi hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept,1,1,601
1303,she treats me like im not in her presence shes always yelling at me for no reason she gives more respect to my brothers than me but only my brothers fight her while i respect her,familyconflict,attention is not equal to love and being valued it may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your moms attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them it is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who dont demand as much attention end up feeling invisible it sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you  this sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out,1,1,761
1304,"i am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home they are peeing in cat litter boxes bottles and directly on floors and in corners of my house
 is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way this is not a joke i am trying to understand",familyconflict,hi this sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out my first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  as far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries be clear about the expectations of your home also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue i hope this helps you your family members and the pets,1,1,673
1305,i am married to a beautiful lady i love my wife with all my heart we have  boys and i have a daughter from a previous marriage we also have  grandchildren now this event is tearing us apart i want our family to be together and happy it was a mistake from so long ago my wife wants to leave and i dont want that to happen i love her so much please help me save my marriage even my  boys want us to work it out they love us both and want our family together please give me some advice or hope sincerely heart broken,familyconflict,if your wife is willing seek out a qualified couples therapist look for one trained in the gottman method or emotionally focused therapy your relationship is repairable but you may need some qualified support in the process,1,1,223
1306,i started dating a guy i met online he told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything he took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years that was more than two decades ago nothing on his record since i always believe the past should be left in past but my roommates their family and my son are unforgiving should i forgive this man that im falling in love with or should i dump him if i stay with him i will never see my family and granddaughter again,familyconflict,thank you for your question trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair from what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive if you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom we cannot control others but only ourselves respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship good luck to you,1,1,739
1307,"im having issues with my relative the police never believe the experiences i have been through because i am only a kid 
   ive even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because i said i wanted to get an adult to help me could you please give me advice",familyconflict,i think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children its called the childhelp national child abuse hotline the number is achild  it is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you wantthe call is completely free and they are open  hours a day   days a week im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation you are a very brave and an intelligent child please remember to call  if you are in immediate danger,1,1,550
1308,i have secrets in my mind and i dont know what to do with them i dont want to tell my wife and mom because i dont want to hurt them but im not sure how long that i can keep the secret to myself what should i do its becoming annoying and making me anxious help me out,familyconflict,it sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now there are several things to consider before you make a decision you mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them  is it necessary for them to know this information what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves if your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel would you want to know the secrets how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthonce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not,1,1,933
1309,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,thanks for your question  communication is essential between couples and often times gets neglected in relationships  working with your husband to help him become a better listener and consequently a better communicator is going to take some work from your part  you have to calmly be able to express to him your concern and how it affects you  very important is that you do it in a loving and nonthreatening way  therefore the time to have this discussion is not when you are frustrated or need to vent to someone about something important  focus the discussion on how both of you could benefit from having more meaningful conversations where both parties are being heard and how it is important to you that he hears you just like it is crucial for him to be heard  there is a lot of useful information online about how to be a good listener or therapist in your area that can help you  be patient and genuine and he will come around  best of luck mirella,1,1,956
1316,i have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man i talked to her about it and she said she will do it for me the idea excites me to no end but i dont want to because it disgusts me how can i stop wanting it or should i just give into it and do it ive been struggling for years with this it wont go away by the way i am in my mid s and my wife is in her mid s,marriage,try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilledsince you and your wife are in a relationship the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wifei suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangementby anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control or in control since its your wish being fulfilled all the feelings you and her are able to expect youll be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the eventthere are a lot of unknowns in the situation youre considering  having your partner who will be key in satisfying your sex wish be active in understanding these unknowns is a good way of keeping your relationship strong overall,1,1,821
1317,my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had i know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over that i am messing around which i am not,marriage,the good news in the way youre feeling is recognizing that your husbands trust of your actions makes a difference to youthe typical therapy formula for restoring trust between two people after some sort of betrayal is for the one who has broken the trust to earn it backrestoring trust requires both persons to actively involve themselves in this processthe person who tires earning back trust must know what standards for this of the one who was betrayedthe person who feels betrayed must willingly be open minded to accepting the efforts of the one who tries earning back their trustas simple as this formula sounds the actual process of restoring trust raises a lot of emotion on both sides therefore causing difficulty in keeping discussions in this area on trackthe best way of success in restoring trust between partners is utilizing a couples therapist who would be able to guide your conversations back on track and also open emotions for discussion when relevant to restoring trustgood luck in establishing new terms with your partner,1,1,1043
1319,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,i appreciate your questionthe answer of what makes a good marriage are as varied as there are marriagesbasically similarity like mindedness in beliefs and values makes a good marriage the best chance of getting along with someone on a longterm basis is when two people see life and the world in similar wayseven though opposites attract this is a short lived dynamic which breaks apart when there arent enough similarities in common between the partners,1,1,453
1326,that phrase makes me crazy it happens anytime i point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his ipad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that i got all the things he needs to bake a pie another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up over and over again he lets the dog run out and i am afraid he will get hit by a car,marriage,i empathize with your feeling crazy hearing your husband yell enough in response to you wanting to make a point to himwhen the immediate situation has calmed down  have you ever told him that this upsets you  is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to youkeep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to changea helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happenedby learning more about how the other person thinks and feels it will be easier to know what to expect form each othereven if you disagree about what is best knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept or at least not be surprised and startled by themsending good luck to both of you,1,1,937
1328,all we do is argue we never agree on anything,marriage,simply yesjust because you argue does not mean your marriage is not worth it couples disagree they are different people from different worlds with different likes and dislikes trying to mesh these different worlds is tough but does not mean you dont need to not be marriedthere are reasons why couples dont get along finding out why you cannot compromise and working towards similar goals can help talking about what you really want out of the marriage and relationship may show yall how much your relationship goals are similar then you can build upon thatlearning communication skills listening skills and ways to improve your ability to express self without anger can help,1,1,675
1330,ive only been married three months every week we argue about something and it seems to be getting worse,marriage,one key factor to consider is are you able to repair after your arguments it seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument when couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forward im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over if youre stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about  minutes the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  when things are good between you  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this cycle and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time that way when this is enacted during an argument nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time rather both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs,1,1,1184
1331,if i tell him i dont like certain things he does when it pertains to me he tells me its not like that he never has anything to say about me until i tell him something about himself,marriage,it sounds like there are issues with communication between you and your husband  your perceptions of interactions that you are having dont sound like they match up  it would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using i statements i feelwhen you  this is a more effective way of communicating your needs than directly criticizing the other person  if you work on communicating in new less critical ways you both may learn more about your spouses feelings and perspective,1,1,490
1332,cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters i decided not to break up the family however now i am struggling to forget and forgive what happened i feel like i cannot trust him without trust i cannot stay in this relationship on the other hand i do not want my children to get hurt im not sure how to move forward,marriage,lets just start with acknowledging that trust is huge and betrayal hurts youre entitled to your feelings all of them and you need to know that your husband understands you that said some ways are more effective at rebuilding and repairing relationships that others i am a big fan of the gottman method for couples therapy especially following infedienity you can read about this approach in gottmans books the science of trust and making love last andor you can seek a gottman certified couples therapist here httpswwwgottmancomprivatetherapy,1,1,542
1333,i love him but he doesnt show me love he talks badly about me to his friends,marriage,so many questions comes to mind when i read your wordsdo you love yourself  what do you love about him  what are you getting from this relationship that is good for you  what are you lacking in yourself that you allow yourself to be treated this wayi can go onif you can answer these questions maybe you will answer your own question of why are you with your husband or even better why you allow your husband to be mean show no love disrespect you  you seem to lack selfworthseek a professional to help you with this,1,1,516
1334,my father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia i have been dealing with that all day my husband keeps getting mad at me for things that i said,marriage,i dont know how long you have been married but this might be a time to explain to your husband what you wish he could do for you in this moment it could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong maybe he would be open to an honest discussion,1,1,315
1335,my husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person before he worked and slept and on off days hed stay home because he didnt want to do anything else now hes going out with friends several nights a week while im still home working a  hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself hes suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife but the whole time im remembering how ive been emotionally starving for the last five years,marriage,it seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally  could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression obviously something has shifted which you do not understand therefore  perhaps you should consider attending couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings  it would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection or shut down connection imago dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches  validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection,1,1,745
1337,i decided to stay and work it out i just dont want to sit on the couch other than that i have been getting over the situation i dont feel it is fair that she expects me to sit on that couch and wont leave me alone about it i can move on and continue to love laugh and play with my wife i just dont want to sit on that couch,marriage,houston its normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger so i get why you dont want to sit on it but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive am i to assume that you cant afford a new one ideally she buys you a new couch but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forward t will be interesting to see if theres anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gone,1,1,435
1338,my husband and i have been together since high school we have been married going on for nearly ten years and we have three beautiful children a few weeks ago my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dads for a while he comes home to see the kids and acts like there is not too much wrong can this marriage be saved or is it too late he said he would go to counseling so i dont think he has given up,marriage,while it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support with appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible im not familiar with the resources available in jackson but im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy so often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress loneliness anger and resentment i commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children the following links provides more information regarding common behaviours that predict staying together or separating and also videos and other resources that can help you get started wishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discovery,1,1,1033
1339,my husband and i wouldve been married for five years come june  our infant daughter just had her birthday shortly before he told me he wanted a divorce he has four other children three of which are from his first wife he decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant the children do not have a good relationship with him now he has another child from a woman he was dating he decided he didnt want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant    it seems to me that there is a pattern he easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the childs life but wants a relationship with them when they are older ive tried to research online but im not getting any answers he also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder he also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have where do you recommend researching this,marriage,this sounds really difficult and i can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband continues to have a relationship with you and your children with that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for in order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do  while it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices,1,1,898
1340,i have been with my husband for almost  years we got engaged a little after  years of being together i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose  when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned i was happy but i couldnt help feeling disappointed too i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldnt help how i was feeling we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding what i wanted will never happen i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just cant control it its ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it plus i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed  why cant i move on,marriage,its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either however like you know the marriage is the most important thing how many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship i assure you that there are plenty try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired focus on what you can control now perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringi would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately but after that close that chapter and move on it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change,1,1,1096

1349,weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker i dont know how to approach this situation how do i ask him about it,relationships,if youd like to ask a question then go ahead and askboyfriendgirlfriend is a close relationship and it is usually understood as an exclusive relationship  youre definitely entitled to know if your wishes to not have him texting another woman are being respectedoften people are afraid to ask because they fear the truth will hurt themin the short term this is definitely truein the long term knowing you are getting what you want and at the very least stating your expectations to your boyfriend will clarify for him what is meaningful in your relationship,1,1,556

1383,"ive been with my partner for  years shes given me no reason not to trust her but lately ive been overreacting a lot when shes just doing normal things i think its triggering my bad past relationships
   how can i get rid of these insecurities and be more trusting with her",relationships,whats most important is that you recognize that what youve been doing is off base  that what youve been feeling is overreacting that you have insecurities and you suspect your actions and reactions are connected to your own past and not to the current situation or to your partner thats an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself its unlikely that you would changethat said you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth not because there is something wrong with you but because youre ready to learn more about yourself and make some creative changes in your behavior yes there are lots of selfhelp books and courses but we humans often make the most progress when we have support in  realtime from another human being who can sit with us point out our blind spots and teach us some skills that are hard to learn on our own,1,1,908
1386,however it seems as though he is really talking to someone other than himself i have even accused him of having a secret phone is he trying to make me crazy on purpose or is he really talking to himself,relationships,some people simply talk to themselves as a way of processing information have you checked in with your husband about this in a nonaccusatory way something like hey babe or whatever sweet name you typically use im so curious what thats all about do you notice that you are talking out loud chances are its just how he thinks things through and is not at all about trying to make you crazy its just one of his quirks youll grow to endear early married life is a time full of discovering one anothers quirks,1,1,504

1398,my exboyfriend and i have been back and forth for over a year now hes in his late s divorced for like five years now with two kids he has a lot of narcissistic behaviors he lies and cheats but i love him ive tried to date other people but i always go back to him,relationships,try to figure out why you go back to himlove is never enough reason to sustain a relationshipthough your love may feel and be very real the fact of the frequent breaks show that some quality or dynamic within the relationship is not satisfying enough to sustain the two of youalways people are better off with some time separation between relationships  this gives a chance to know what you were looking for and dint find in the ended relationshipdating other people before you have time to understand what did and didnt work well in a relationship will make the new dates seem like a lacking comparison to the first guyalso lying and cheating are very demoralizing  maybe your higher self tries to take you out from this situation and you first need to strengthen your spirit in order to follow your own best interest,1,1,818
1400,i have been holding myself for nearly a month i can not bear it he is isolated from everybody and i want to help but i cannot find him,relationships,if you mean he has been reported to police as missing then this is different than him deciding to make himself unavailable to you and othersif the police cannot find him then there is a level of risk or secrecy to his whereabouts beyond someone simply shutting themselves off temporarily from othersthe best you can do is selfcomfort from the surprise and possibly shock of his behaviorfrom your description whether or not he reappears is up to him returning or up to police skill to locate himthis is beyond the ordinary abilities of average everyday people even those who are involved relationship wise with someone,1,1,617

1404,i met the first man five months ago i have come a long way and do have feelings for him i know he would do anything for me and my kids the man i love is their father and no matter how many times things havent been great in the past i cant help but love him i know they both love me and i love both of them,relationships,the answer depends entirely on which interest is stronger for youif the reliable caretaker man is not someone with whom youd have fun lively conversations understand each other be sexually compatible or romantically attracted and your primary interest is in someone who steadily manage the kids household and finances then he is the right one for youthe problem is you may not be happy longterm with someone to whom you feel no romantic compatibility consider the drawback if you reach the moment of restlessness romantically and are with someone on whom you depend to take care of your kidssince you have feelings for him then wait several months longer to see whether or not you can imagine yourself romantically happy with the steady guyif the other guy who is also the bio dad isnt involved with his own kids then he seems like a poor choice of someone to be with longterm,1,1,876
1405,i have had a crush on this guy for years i last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school we left off on a good note should i message him and see how he is doing or is it too late,relationships,youll only find out whether or not it is too late by following through with wanting to message himregardless of whether the response you receive is what youd hoped to hear including not hearing back from him you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity youve had for some time,1,1,330
1407,theres this boy who asked me out awhile ago i said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me how do i be with him and tell him and tell my friends,relationships,since youve decided to be with the boy who already showed you his interest then why not simply tell him you decided to accept his invitation to be togetherprobably your first concern about hesitating to accept this boy into your life due to the way you imagine your family may react if you do is the more complex matter to solveforming a relationship does bring up our values and the way these are different or similar to our own    at the same time we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew upyour dilemma of wanting to be with this boy shows there is a clash between your values as an individual including your choice of partner and the way your family understands the values which support being part of a couplestay true to what you feel whether this comes from your family or the way you currently are evolvingthis will guarantee that your new relationship will be built on the values and person you truly are,1,1,953
1408,we have been together for a little bit and i love him to death but my mental health is so unstable i question everything he does from loving me to if my body is good enough im super jealous for no reason and my temper is super short hes pretty much done he said i have a bit more than a week to fix it,relationships,are there ways your partner acknowledges the difficulty to stabilize the questions you ask about your selfworthyour questions are typical for anyone who feels insecure and unsure  the lack of confidence you feel exists in many other human beings tooyour partners wish for you to feel better about yourself is fine   the problem is he seems more interested for you to solve the problem for his sake than for your sakeas long as he considers you an obstacle to his happiness and not someone he loves and would like to help improve their inner stability then he doesnt offer you more of his selfinterest than of his lovea week is an unrealistic timeframe to cure the subject you describeany time line misses the point of how humans evolve and not automatically changehe also is either missing or isnt interested in supporting your emotional progress,1,1,846
1409,"about two and a half months ago i met a woman on a dating site we went out on two dates and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date we respectfully tried not to have sex but after hours of trying to resist each other we gave in and we had sex after that i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks then one day she went to her familys house on thanksgiving and everything changed within the short time we were together we got so close and serious really fast we had finally found each other we told each other that we loved each other all the time even while we were making love a few days after thanksgiving she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently i was very hurt and didnt understand then another week later she told me she couldnt do it at all anymore i was crushed
   a few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her so for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen she had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused she doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly i know she needs time and all i can do is take care of myself we have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again im completely in love with her and im in extreme pain",relationships,that sounds really heartbreaking it is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side it sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking care of myself while the rest sorts itself out while i admire your desire and courage to stay friends  the extreme pain that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you i would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you dont end up feeling strung along or resentful make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time  we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken,1,1,768
1411,i have suffered many things at home and school we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing i try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman,relationships,maybe the reason is not having confidence in the love you give to yourselfpossibly you consider the quality of your selflove as inferior to love someone else gives youthe best way to push through to your own selfcomfort and acceptance is to be aware of this tendency so you can remind yourself to practice appreciating the unique love you give to yourself,1,1,355
1414,im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her how can i learn how to listen and get myself together,relationships,what an important question and the fact that youre asking it is a big step in the right direction to answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what relationship problems have occurred  that woke you up to the fact that youre not listening as well as you could and that youre running the risk of losing hergiven that i dont have all that information ill offer one simple suggestion your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship you could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize youre not yet understanding what she needs and you really want to then take a deep breath settle down and listen dont argue dont interrupt dont judge listen let her know what you understand and that youre open to hearing more learning more if youre not quite getting it yet and then listen some more be present and curious about this person you love dearly and dont want to lose this is the first step toward intimacy,1,1,1029
1419,i told him i liked him he called me lovely and pretty but he said he didnt want a relationship he would always flirt with me,relationships,well as disappointed as you may very well feel from hearing this guys answer you know he doesnt want a relationshipwhat type of move would you like him to makeif you mean youd be happy to have sex with this guy and not a relationship then wait for as long as your patience allowsto wait for him to change his mind that he does want a relationship doesnt have a very strong base on which to standits possible to do this only consider the emotional price of your frustration to wait for someone to change their mind,1,1,513
1420,i met this girl in high school she had switched schools at the end of the year and i have not seen her since its been a few years we had a very good and friendly relationship and we seemed to have a lot in common i never gained the courage to ask her out,relationships,one way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way youd handle a similar situation in the futuresince a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis right now youve got no idea if youd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years agothe relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner  that you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize  this way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property  to have lots of similar interests is another quality you appreciate in a partnerthe more you know about what you do and dont like in a partner the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path,1,1,804
1421,my boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction we recently got into a fight and he has become very distant i dont know what to do to fix the relationship,relationships,my empathy goes out to you relationships are tough enough and im sure your partner being distant has been upsetting for you you are confused and want to mend the relationship with him but are finding it so hard to do relationships require both people to work consistently in order to keep them happier but if it is only you that is actively trying to repair the relationship it can be emotionally draining perhaps expressing you feel using i you statements can be beneficial do not accuse him or use you statements like you are so distant  or you dont even carestart out sharing your feelings by saying i feel sad when you dont return my phone calls or i feel confused about our relationship ever since you have been keeping to yourself he may have a valid point or might have been hurt by the argument and retreated as a result of it regardless of why use this time as a great opportunity to practice healthy communication if you think you are not ready for a conversation like that couples counseling can be excellent you will have a skilled facilitator guide the conversation and help you both communicate with one another,1,1,1125
1424,i was never single afraid to be alone and i looked for my boyfriend to make me happy i finally worked on my self was in a relationship and i did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didnt work out now months later no man peaks my interest am i ready to date again is there a reason no one sparks my interest,relationships,yes of course theres a reasontheres always a reason for most dynamicsdepending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would gosince you already are on the best road possible for yourself since this resulted from your own introspection keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow,1,1,477
1425,my boyfriend is always saying hes done with me and says hes leaving but then at the end of the night hes still here he wakes up in the morning acts like nothing happen and repeats this every night,relationships,do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to itare you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him betterbasically first know your own reason for your question   then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you  in the best of cases he doesnt realize how his actions affect you and he will change,1,1,379
1426,i was with my boyfriend for years on and off we dated and broke up three times since we broke up five months ago i cant move on i want to get back together but he wont talk to me what should i do,relationships,probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for youwhen a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly  a break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life not only that the person is no longer connected with ussince your boyfriend isnt talking to you then youre keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions  theres nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking this person is the only one whos in charge to start talkingmaybe since youve had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before youre willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanentbe patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship  once enough time passes so that youre considerably past the point at which you and he come together then accepting his leavetaking will feel naturalright now its very understandable to have hope since youve been on this road before  in time youll have your answer as to whether your future is with him or not,1,1,1117
1427,i really like this guy and i think he likes me back but his sister is my bestfriend im afraid that if i tell her i have a crush on her brother she would loose it i once told her i thought her brother was cute and she got really angry ive gotten to know her brother better lately and ive realized he may actually feel the same way i dont want to lose her friendship what do i do,relationships,do you and the brother to whom you feel attracted ever see each other or are in surroundings in which the sisteryour friend isntif yes then this gives you the chance to find out whether you and the brother actually do like each otherif no then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact youre attracted to the brotherfind out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brotheranything is possible from shed like to warn you about qualities in her brother which you may not know and if you did wouldnt like or react negativelyor if protection isnt your friends reason then maybe shes fearful to lose your friendship if you start a relationship with the brotherfriends are people who care about each others lives  let your friendship with this girl work on behalf of each of you,1,1,830
1428,"i feel like i took our relationship for granted and hes now to the point that hes giving up
   i have had trouble feeling like i could trust him but hes given me no reason not to trust him i know my attitude is also a big issue for him i have a lot of obligations at home so we dont spend a lot of time together    how can i fix this relationship",relationships,a key factor in a relationship is trustid start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bfdoes this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships or with a sibling or parentits also possible youre intuitively sensing you cant trust your bf bc hes not trustworthy  sometimes people sense the basic safety items in a relationship before they emergealso your bf may have similarly suffered broken trust and he gives off a feeling of not welcoming your trustits possible youre feeling his own selfprotection about being in a relationship with youthe best way to open these topics is to actually talk about them together with himwhatever the underlying tensions are talking about them always adds positive feeling and confidence to a relationship,1,1,795
1429,whenever i sing along with a song that i like even if its just for the beat and not the lyrics my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship    i dont why he gets so mad and assumes i mean something negative from every song now i cant enjoy and sing a song without him thinking im trying to give him a hint he even accuses me of cheating and lying its driving me nuts i love him and would never do such an awful thing ever how can i get him to understand,relationships,well have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote herethis will give him the same understanding youre allowing us to have here on this sitekeep in mind that the best the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information is in his hands onlytry to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself   another path to open is to ask your boyfriend his reason to feel insecure about your love for him  this may open a wider discussion about what he feels hed like from you so he feels good in the relationship,1,1,657
1430,i have a lot of child custody concerns financial issues insecurities and weigh gain i also have no local family support its hard for me to stay positive i get very emotional and take it out on the people i love how can i stay strong,relationships,theres online forums and blogs some of which have interactive discussion groupsalso depending on exactly  what you mean by becoming emotional feeling overwhelmed by feelings typically happens when people feel a lot of stress and pressure in their lives   loneliness contributes to feeling overwhelmed tooyour feelings may be perfectly normalsimilarly depending on what you mean take it out on people you may be expecting too much of yourselfif youre expecting other people to listen to your upset feelings this is reasonableif youre harming them as a a result of your upset feelings this is unreasonabledepending on what exactly you are doing when you take it out you may be quite reasonable to do so,1,1,700
1431,i was talking to my fiance about changing my hair he recommended a very specific hair style then i found out his ex has that exact same hair i feel like he must know she has that hair style am i nuts or does this show that hes still in love with her,relationships,maybe your finances hair preference for you reflects he still is in love w the exthere are other many reasonable options toomaybe he doesnt know a lot about hair styles or didnt want to even think through the question carefully and also didnt want to tell you this directlyhe may have tried to take the easy way out of involving himself in your questionthe key whether or not he loves you is how you feel most of the time in your relationship   if most of the time you trust the sense you are loved and you love him then this gives you some reassurance about how the both of you feel toward each otherit is possible too that your finance has some remaining feelings for the ex   whether or not this makes any difference to you depends on how stable and reliable you feel is the love between the two of you,1,1,805
1432,"my girlfriend recently started hanging out a lot more with one of her friends who did her wrong in the past and just walked out on her so for the past  years its been just me and my girlfriend things have been great up until the last month now she ignores me and texts and hangs oit with her friend more and more
   i dont know what to do anymore my girlfriend is so distant how do i keep from losing her",relationships,well if you each want to be with the other than no one will be losthave you told her about feeling slighted  start telling her about your feelings  how she responds to you will tell you a lot about where her heart is and maybe too some of the reasons she has been so involved w the friendwho knows maybe the friend has problems of her own and your gf is spending extra time w the friend to help the friend and doesnt even know you feel hurtyou would do yourself and your gf a lot of good to tell more about your feelings  either you will get more closeness and consideration or not  at least you will have the truth,1,1,615
1433,i dont speak up if im uncomfortable and hardly ever make plans for us when we hang out he is a very open and straightforward person so he is getting upset with me for my lack of proper communication weve been together two years and have identified this as our main problem arguments have arised from this single issue many times,relationships,do you know what youre afraid may happen if you do speak upusually people dont talk freely because they feel afraid to do so  sometimes the fear of being rejected by the other of being criticized or judged by the other person or that what you will say stirs anger in the other personif you are able to know what your particular reason is for not talking then maybe you and your partner can talk about what makes talking easy or hardalso since speaking up is new for you then ask your partner to be patient while you learn to do so  everyone does better at learning new skills when they feel supported and welcomed,1,1,613
1434,weve been together almost three years we argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me its hurtful because i am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if i drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say i am sorry how can this be resolved we have kids and i dont want a broken family because we cant communicate,relationships,under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge so while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you in simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience and that still fell short of what you needed you are both still trying to get very early needs met the best advice i can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful and seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck pointavraham cohen phd rcc ccc,1,1,903
1438,my boyfriend called me a particular profanity and i broke up with him this is the third time hes called me this and im just completely done with giving him chances he knows how much it bothers me i just want to know if im over reacting,relationships,it sounds like you are reacting to an issue in communication patterns rather than a particular word  the ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship  if your partner is not listening to acknowledging and remembering your wishes that is likely an indicator of some fissures in the foundation of the relationship,1,1,406
1439,my boyfriend is in ireland for  days and i am an emotional wreck,relationships,it sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close  do you typically spend most of your time together  if so it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart  if any separation is difficult you may need to examine why  think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious upset or worried about  if you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief   it is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend,1,1,538
1440,when i ask him who he is talking to he tells me no one but it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone i have even accused him of having a secret cell phone i ask so much i feel like i am losing it is he trying to make me question my sanity or is he talking to himself,relationships,a rare topic  likely extremely troublesome for you i would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight feel free to email mei would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level  partners need each others trust and support no matter who is right or wrong,1,1,467
1441,we had great chemistry but then he became distant i had the feeling that i cant be without him as soon as i felt the difference i was scared to lose him i started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened,relationships,the simplest answer is that love feels good obsessions dontlove deepens a sense of peacefulness and securityobsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandonedone suggestion is to study more about yourself and why youd feel so ill at ease when you arent w this person,1,1,270
1442,im in my early s my exs parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me i left my ex due to an abusive situation and they are making me look like i was the bad one,relationships,maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future if you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex that could be one element of the discussion but it doesnt have to bei dont know how long we have been together with your current partner but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time that may be a discussion to have with them as wellhopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations,1,1,588
1443,i try to do everything right just so we wont argue and it doesnt help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol i get anxiety over having fights with him,relationships,because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fightswhen you do everything right are you saying that you dont argue it sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively i recommend working on this with a therapist though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm,1,1,641
1444,ever since i was little i loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them i treated everyone nice for girls i liked i would spend every second with them it always ends the same way i like you as a friend or i love your attention but not you,relationships,attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time maybe when youre in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with andor what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection,1,1,276
1445,im in a relationship but i feel like im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated my ex told me that i will never find anyone else and thats lingering in the back of my mind,relationships,the most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter thats why it didnt work with him btw he wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered however it ended clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you so here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message move on you arent unworthy you just havent found a man who is worthy of you to be worthy of you he must see your worth often though before anyone else can see your worth you have to believe it,1,1,610
1446,i blame my past relationship for it i know it is bad to be this way i want to get past it,relationships,we humans are social beings we learn how to be in relationship as children the caregiving you received or didnt receive set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen perhaps feeling like you dont matter there are many ways to rewire these relational patterns the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure  so congrats on that because clearly you are already there  next id suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities either as a couple or individually,1,1,628
1448,i am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried viagra cialis etc nothing seemed to work my girlfriend of  years is very sexually frustrated i told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men is that really okay,relationships,hello and thank you for your question i completely agree with dr zehner many couples are in opentype or polyamorous relationships where one or both partners engage in sexual relationships with others the key thing about this is that it really does have to be something that both people are okay with now as dr zehner indicated what may be okay today may not feel okay tomorrow so good communication is essential the truth is even in polyamorous relationships where partners are in agreement jealousy does sometimes happen here is a good article about polyamorous relationships and the issue of jealousy httpeverydayfeminismcompolyamorousdealingjealousythis site has many other articles about polyamory if you type in polyamory in their search box you will find some good information i wish you wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc,1,1,826
1449,i was addicted to porn since the second grade im in my early s and overcame my addiction during my separation from my wife of  years,relationships,the person who can answer this question is the person you want to rebuild that trust with  they are the only one who can tell you what it will take for them to trust you again  what they tell you may seem hard or impossible but unfortunately that is what they need  it is up to you if you feel and know you can provide what they request,1,1,336
1450,he isnt violent but he has anger issues and deep insecurities hes working on them and has improved we started counseling and he participated in one or two individual sessions but we broke up again shortly thereafter now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining,relationships,from what you write youre not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own lifewhat keeps you feeling connected to him in positive waysif youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining,1,1,317
1452,ive been with him for a couple months we will talk everyday and he will get mad over something i will say and not talk to me we have our great moments but i just need to focus on my personal situations and i feel he is slowing me down with that i still wanna be with him but not now,relationships,it sounds like youre pulling away instead of being honest if you really want to be with him why not now if you dont have time for a relationship why are you dating at alli dont understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days or ghosting where you just stop talking and disappear i get the sense that this relationship isnt working for you but for some reason youre stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it in the early stage of a relationship the first year if it doesnt feel fabulous its a good idea to move on its not personal you dont owe this person anything they deserve someone whos totally into them and so do you and youre doing him no favors by hanging on to something thats not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime you dont have to slowly bow out it actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty maybe people dont know how to say itive decided not to continue with this i wish you the best life is too short,1,1,1010
1455,i found out my boyfriend takes antidepression medicine lately hes been saying he has a lot on his mind and he needs time to think about us weve only been dating  weeks but i like him a lot,relationships,give him the time and space he needs  obviously something is going on with him that he needs time to process think about and work through  respect that most men are not talkers but more thinkers  if and when he is ready to talk he will  when and if he does talk be a comforting listener and put yourself in his shoes the best you can to be the support he needs  dont take it personal because you just been dating  weeks and his depression maybe something that been going on for a while  if you do like himshowing him by being patient and supportive at this time,1,1,561
1458,i have several issues like i dont like people they make me sick i have issues with talking to people i feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me i have felt this way for years when i look people in the eyes i have voices that tell me to hurt them and if i dont stop looking at who i am talking to it gets so loud i cant hear what they are saying i just stay away from people to avoid this i look at people and think how i could hurt them i feel like i am worthless and would be better off not in this world where i dont fit in every day i wake up its like another day any info would be good,relationships,sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain  i would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically  then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist  seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms    after getting these evaluations your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing  whether treatment includes medication andor psychotherapist would be discussed  please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up,1,1,692
1459,now that the other girl is out of the picture our sex life isnt the same is it because he is still thinking about the other girl,relationships,orbetter yet is it you still thinking about the other girl  i am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well  make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well  sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about,1,1,310
1460,i was in a relationship with him for three years my mom doesnt like it because she thinks im making a mistake he got married a few months after we broke up and now he is divorced i forgave him for what he did in the past and he says hes sorry and he really loves me i love him too but is it bad that im giving him a second chance again,relationships,hey it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes your mom wants to protect you i get that maybe she is worried youll be hurt again were you hurt in some way by him can you understand where shes coming from sometimes when were mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom its hard to know how to repair moms relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong that the picture you may have painted of him isnt the total picture she might need help there thank your mom for her love and care and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether youre together or not that its a risk you are going to take and that you really need her support ,1,1,878
1461,i am currently living in a hotel and i dont have a family i met a guy a month ago he is a bisexual he has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites he would not help pay for the room when i asked for the tv remote control he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it i slapped him and asked him to leave my room we recently just got back together one time i was sick he came to visit and feed me but left no money then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that i have struggles living at a hotel he says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever i need someone to have sex with he left his bath soap so he could come and get it i think that he is trying to find a way to come back please help me whats going on i am a good loyal woman why is he treating me like this,relationships,i am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends than about how you feel is treating you  you are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation  if you have friends to talk to please reach out  while this man has money it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together  it sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected  i would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care  this is not your fault  but you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs  take care,1,1,646
1462,i have been dating my boyfriend for a month and we want a baby we dont work or drive and we havent talked to our parents what should we do,relationships,hi athens when a teenager wants to have a baby its usually for a specific and not healthy reason do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship it doesnt work that way do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply babies dont give to us we give endlessly to them i urge you to talk to someone you trust about why you want to speed up your life by being a parent before you are fully grown emotionally a relationship that is one month old is not stable enough to support a change like this youre only starting to get to know each other i wish you well and hope you talk to someone,1,1,597
1463,i was hanging out with my close guy friend we started kissing but afterwards he said that we should just stay friends because he doesnt want to ruin anything we both just got out of relationships his was very sexual im not a sexual person and he knows that i want to be with him but im not ready for another relationship and i dont know if he ever will want to be more than friends,relationships,given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfactionsuddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persons energy stay focused on what you know about yourself which is that youre not ready for another relationshipfrom what you describe about your friend similar to you he does not feel ready for a new relationshipif and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive then youll be in a position to find out either by approaching your friend as a potential partner or by asking your question of his interest in youwho knowsit is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship approach you and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become accept his offergood luck with step one becoming familiar with your new state of single hood and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship,1,1,1112
1464,my girlfriend broke up with me five months ago because i said awful things to her one night for no reason of hers i have been trying to get her back but it isnt easy she is in her s and i am in my s she is the one i want for my life and this is killing me every day i cry and i am desperate for help,relationships,new york what would it mean about you if you got her back is that the only way you can like or forgive yourselfif she forgives you and takes you back your self respect doesnt need to rely on this working with her she simply doesnt want to be with you and every day that you refuse to honour her decision is another day that you hurt her all over again move on and heal perhaps with the help of a therapist,1,1,405
1465,im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend at the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date he has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two i have nothing against her except for the fact that she has tims heart he is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but i dont really believe him    lately tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year hes been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her but hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves he seems really torn up about it and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves    he knows that i still crush on him he doesnt rub it in my face hes a good guy but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us how do i do that when the time comes how do i support him and show him that im here without wanting to hook up how do i make him feel better he is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which i think is ridiculous,relationships,first off i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelings and understanding regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upim not sure if that is possible if you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues good luck to you,1,1,977
1466,i have been seeing this guy for a little over a year back in august he asked for us to step back for now since then he has still been in contact with me every day we spent some time together over the holidays but then i was gone for new years with family i came to find out that he put himself on a dating site when i found out i asked him about it and he responded with this my apologies if i got my signals crossed or if i wasnt honest with you you have helped me tons this past year and i am glad you are in my life i didnt realize you were still interested in dating again my apologies also is it better to say that i want him in my life or that i want him as part of my life,relationships,it sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other do you know what type of relationship you want with him a friendship only casual dating or an exclusive relationship i would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises by clearing the air and learning what your own and each others desires are you can then move forward with a plan without that clarification there will likely be false assumptions unanswered questions and confusion,1,1,704
1467,my girlfriend and i have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years we recently just broke up again last night on new years eve when we break up the very next day she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened she acts like everything is alright this has been going on for two years i do love her and care about her and her children a lot but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man she is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man it makes me feel like crap because i cannot give her everything that she wants she told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her is that a normal thing that women want or should i just move on already i am in my s and she is in her s,relationships,love is not enough to keep a relationship togetherthe people need to get along happily toolets start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partnerthe frequent break ups happen for a reason  try understanding more of why you go back together againyou state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship such as feeling like crap and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave hertrust your intuition telling you that these feelings mattersometimes men arent sure whether following their instinct is a right action to takeit isalso hoping a partner will fear losing them shows a wish to control a personcontrol has nothing to do with love and trust and these are basics of a relationshipgood luck,1,1,761
1468,i broke up with him three weeks ago because i felt that he needed to be more respectful he has since had a rebound relationship he says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me he says its going to be too difficult to see me every time we talk it feels like im being pushy to see him he used to be so madly in love with me but now it seems like he couldnt care less i think im running him away,relationships,hi kansasi think your first instinct was good you broke up with him you deserve respect but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants which is space do you think hes going to be any different with her this a common unfounded fear we have i wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him the bottom line is you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone be loving towards you because how someone treats you and the choices they make has everything to do with who they are and nothing to do with who you are i hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future,1,1,822
1469,i find that i imagine things sexually and i hate it because it puts strain on my relationship i feel helpless and guilty i want it to go away and i want to make my woman happy again,relationships,it is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away however your feeling that you cant control having these thoughts is accurate its also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship though i would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you arent choosing to have these thoughts im sure that if there was a switch to turn them off you would flip itthere is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away however therapy may still have a lot to offer in working with a competent therapist you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away this may also be a result of work with a therapist either way you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner,1,1,1151
1470,my boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago i love him but his dog is wrecking my house every day we get home there is a huge mess on the floor and several things will be ripped up including the couch hes slowly eating all of the doors and there will be food and poop everywhere even though i come home during all of my breaks to take him out he still poops and pees in the house every chance i cant financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house ive tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution but it never ends well the dog is the only thing we fight about because i want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesnt want to see him go its not the dog fault though i understand that the dog is only a year old and he isnt a bad dog hes just too big of a dog for where he is he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog i dont hate the dog but i just cant afford to continue having my house torn to pieces,relationships,every living creature needs time and support to adjust to a new situationthe dog is in a new place without the ability to understand the reason  this may explain what sounds like the dogs agitation  have you spoken with your boyfriend on his opinion on how to address the dog behavior problemsfinding an answer together would be a good way of making your relationship stronger  a lot of being a couple who live together is talking listening and deciding together on how to handle major situationsif it is affordable then a dog behaviorist may be of great help  the person would guide you in working with the dog to become calmer,1,1,628
1471,i had to go to the emergency room today to get an xray of my spine my boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me instead he wanted to go do things for his friends while i waited when i was done he was twenty minutes late in picking me up he doesnt understand why im mad and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things he thinks i dont have a reason to be mad but i believe that i do,relationships,it is extremely frustrating when our significant other doesnt understand our points of view often times arguments are not the best opportunities to try and make a point as strong emotions can get in the way of understanding others perspectives try having a discussion with him about what is bothering you during a time when neither if you are upset or arguing communicate how you feel without placing blame and without yelling addionally give him ideas of what he can do differently so that he understands what your expectations are lastly consider seeing a couples therapist who can assist with teaching more effective communication techniques best of luck,1,1,657
1473,my longdistance girlfriend is in a sorority and its changing her i feel like im becoming less important to her and it hurts she just wants me to support the sorority but its so hard i try every day to show her shes the most important thing to me but she cant even stay relatively sober at a fraternity party for me so that i wont worry about her doing anything regretful we love each other but were in a rough patch,relationships,you may already be doing as much as possible for your relationshipeach of you are  of the relationshipis the  which your gf contributes to your relationship based on the same understanding of the couples problem as you havemaybe a good starting place for the two of you to talk about is defining what problem the two of you have as a couplethis way each of you will be able to know if you have similar values and definitions of your reasons for being togetherdepending on what you each expect from your partnership you each will clearly know whether and then how to accommodate the other personthese discussions stir a lot of emotions in each person so that sometimes staying clear minded becomes very difficult  you both will likely feel like talking about these matters more than one timeconsider utilizing a professional credentialed and licensed therapist who would help the two of you stay on track with examine your emotional connections in a fair and safe waygood luck with understanding and appreciating your relationship,1,1,1029
1474,"every once and a while i think about my exboyfriend from four years ago and my current friend its like i cant get past it and i need some kind of closure i keep thinking about how we had something but it got cut off due to parental intervention nothing was ever wrong with it now weve become friends but theres this huge sexual tension between us or at least i feel it when were physically in the same place
   two summers ago we saw each other casually for a while but we never had sex then or while we were dating which was only for two months three years ago im now in my s and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his s despite the age difference i know were a really good match weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out i tell him everything also my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing that summer i told him i didnt want anything serious and broke it off only a week later he had gotten back together with his girlfriend his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited im sure she may be different around him but i worry about him committing to her in the long run theyre supposed to move in together soon but still i feel this connection with my exboyfriend and i feel like he does too    i dont know what to do i need some closure or im not going to be able to move on from this i dont know what it is but its driving me crazy im so happy with my current boyfriend and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling hes such a good person i also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but i cant get it out of my head im trying to take a nap right now between classes but i cant sleep because my mind is racing ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever
   i want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but i dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face if he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me if my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed on one hand i want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too where would i go from there on the other hand i feel like i cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but i dont want to
   please help me because i really have no idea what to do",relationships,if youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that although you say youre happy id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason thats a pretty important element to be missingit may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex if you feel the need to see what is possible there i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first you cant have everythingif you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship the grass isnt greener a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future,1,1,1144
1475,after  years i fell in love for the first time the person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye my heart is burning and i cant take this pain,relationships,ouch losing someone you love hurts so much we all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful while it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances i would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life when we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family while no one is going to be able to make it better we dont have to be alone with our pain if you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see  a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for,1,1,816
1476,my exboyfriend and i met over a year ago we hit it off and fell in love pretty quick however he has trust issues and assumed i was cheating when i found out i was pregnant we had just broken up five months later i lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid i will hurt him again i just want to know where to go with this because i love him so much and i want to get back to us being happy and a family,relationships,trust is essential in romantic relationships and it is common to have trust issues  because the stakes are so high if both of you are committed and willing to be fully honest with each other trust can be repaired and become stronger than ever i would encourage you to seek out professional help as it easy to get derailed by fear when trying to work things out in the absence of trust when fear takes over  we tend to become defensive and act in ways that makes it harder to trust one another in addition to getting professional support i would encourage you to learn more about building trust in relationships and deepening connection through accessing various online resources on relationships,1,1,695
1477,my exboyfriend will not stop harassing and stalking me we work together i honestly think he needs help to move on his accusations are angry lies but i think he may believe them to be true,relationships,the specific laws about this will vary from state to state  generally the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else or if they are unable to care for themself  more importantly is dealing with your safety  most states have laws that make stalking a crime you might want to think about filing a police report and obtaining a restraining order against him  you could also think about contacting a local counselor while you cant force him to get help with moving on from the relationship counseling could help you to deal with what is going on,1,1,620
1478,my boyfriend says im nuts i need to get help because i get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me whenever i try to talk with him about it he always turns it around on me by telling me what im doing wrong i know that accusing him does not help when his whole demeanor shifts towards me i cant help but think that something is wrong am i wrong for feeling this way i try to talk with him to make it better i let him know when i am feeling down but i am not confident in these things  two weeks ago a girl texted his phone  times trying to hook up with him he texted her back with sorry ive been working i just read your message the girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me he texted her back with dont text me anymore i dont feel like i am way out of the line but i cant talk with him if all that he will say is that im crazy and i need help what should i do how will i go about checking if there really is something wrong with me,relationships,trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other peopleyou gave examples which strongly suggest thisquite commonly a person twist someones words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and others behavioryour intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you not that youre seeing things incorrectlyone way to check if youre totally misreading him is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationshipsif no one else who knows you tells you that youre crazy then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrongalso a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfrienda therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion what to do with your newfound clarity,1,1,873
1479,i want us all to get along but feel that i am not being respected of course i do have some insecurities because he was with his ex for  years he wants to see his step daughter and ex makes it so he has to go there to see her but she doesnt want me around she has a boyfriend but mine fixes their vehicles goes over once a week and hangs out with the ex and does family things with her since he works nights i only see him parts of fridaysunday and we live together he wont let me use his phone when i forgot mine says his ex used to mess with it i dont think hes cheating but he will lie about what time he actually left her place to come home or about going over early to be with them i feel like the other woman she has tried to mess with holiday plans by restricting when he can see the child he only dated once person before her so this could be why i dont feel he has let go enough he is a wonderful boyfriend other than this,relationships,how much of your unhappiness with your boyfriends way of handling himself regarding his ex have you told himthe topics that upset you are the core of any intimate relationshipthe good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partnerthere may not be any bad news depending on whether your boyfriend has the interest to adjust what he does regarding the extalking the matters you list may open a lot of emotion and become sidetracked very easilya couples therapist whose focus is on the couple not either of you as individuals may be useful to you and your boyfriend so that you are able to complete your discussions without getting lost by the emotions raised,1,1,682
1480,then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me this rollercoaster is crazy,relationships,your partners obviously very confused when it comes to love sometimes people shy away from good and positive relationships and companionship because their afraid they know that its something worth holding on to but most feel they cant handle it and cant meet up to their partners expectations your partner loves you but must have fear that keeps standing in his way it could also mean their afraid of getting hurt or disapointed in the long run  give your partner comfort and reassurance that they can come to you to confide in you about anything that may be bothering them,1,1,573
1482,why am i attracted to older men,relationships,what a wonderful questiongood for you on clearly knowing your prioritiesif i was sitting with you now id ask you to list your reasonsstart with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little furtherif for example you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self even when this sets you apart from your friendsif you feel you need a man to protect you financially then possibly youve lost faith in your ability to financially support yourselfif youd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately then youve found the best reason for wanting a man in your lifethis is far different than need,1,1,759
1483,we went out had great sex and i was really liking her then one day she says we should just be friends but i cant stop thinking about her shes always on mind and i want her back,relationships,it can be really difficult when someone you care about doesnt feel the same about you the most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way  there is nothing you can do to force her to want to be in a relationship with youin the end if she just wants to be friends then shes probably not the right match for youremember every relationship ends  until that last one that doesnt  and that is how its supposed to be,1,1,443
1484,i know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him once he believes i am being negative i cant seem to find a better way of communicating in fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating    what advice might you offer,relationships,with any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc  begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense modethen share how you felt at the time of the event  just say when i felt kind of hurt  shocked or whatever the feeling was  period  thats all you should say  wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statementno matter what his response is stick to your same message  dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  you can even add i agree i could have misunderstood  it event i just know it made me feel uneasyhere you give him little wiggle room for a debategood luck  id love to hear how it goes,1,1,987
1485,what do i do if i have been feeling like i could never be with anyone because no one would want me or i couldnt have many friends because of who i am its strange i want to be loved but id hate to be because i always lose,relationships,as a relationship therapist i work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood how did you caregivers express or not express love towards you how did they express or not express love towards one another these early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others in his book wired for love stan tatkin psyd writes we learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone we learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us our self worth and selfesteem also develop because of other people  this could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it you may have to interview a few to find the right fit thats ok maybe youd even want to read that book i linked above  noticing this pattern is huge its where transformation begins and now that you have be kind with yourself it begins there too,1,1,1066
1486,he goes out with her to dinnerbrunchmovies when we are not together we live  hours apart,relationships,would you have the same desire to meet this friend if she were a he if you are concerned that their friendship is a substitute for you when you arent present talk to him it sounds like you are concerned that he is building an emotional intimacy with her and spending time doing the sort of things with her that youd otherwise be doing with him help him understand why this bothers you but try to also be open to allowing him to make friends is the issue that he hasnt introduced you is there another reason you dont trust their friendship,1,1,538
1487,my girlfriends grandma passed away  months ago they were very close she took care of her till she died things kinda returned to normal few weeks later last month it feels like we hit a brick wall intimacy fell off i asked whats up she says she cant connect with anyone and that its not me she used to be very open and expressive now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching when we did have sex in the last month something felt really off now im very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating she says otherwise but i dont know it just feels like something is really off,relationships,grief has a huge impact on us and everyones reaction is different the one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves her relationship with her grandmother was close given she took care of her up until she passed it sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you or anyone else is likely low right now trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it if she finds it too difficult to connect again a good grief counselor can help her get back on track,1,1,544
1488,he is in his late thirties and i am in my mid twenties we have been together for about  months i really like him he says he cares about me and is willing to fight to make things right he has been very apologetic and expressed he did it out of fear i dont know if its worth giving him a second chance,relationships,cheating is often a sign that something is amiss in the relationship his fear may be full of information while its possible to repair relationships after a betrayal its also challenging to do especially so early in your relationship i cant tell you if you shouldshouldnt give this relationship a second chance but i will tell you to tune into your own intuition and follow your own fears in doing so they often are incredibly informative when we dont push them away with denial,1,1,477
1489,i keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations i take them on and help them and do all i can and the relationship still fails how do i learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations i see someone in need of help i jump in and it is getting me nowhere i am alone sad and frustrated,relationships,sounds like you already see whats amiss youre looking for fixeruppers when you meet these men they need you and youre filled by fixing them  and when they are fixed what do they have to give you whats your need in relationship what if you found someone who didnt need fixing,1,1,274
1490,we kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls it went on for about  months just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room once i met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop we ended up kissing after lunch and then i sent him a few more texts that day telling him i was serious and that was the end of it his wife my good friend saw us kiss once and told my husband i told him a couple of things then and we got over it a year later she told him a couple of other things same story its been about  years since they are now divorced and my husband and i have been happy a few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did i decided to just tell my husband everything we are trying to work things out but he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it how can i help him believe me,relationships,the issue at hand here is that youre betrayal broke his trust in order to repair your relationship you will both need to confront the infidelity and both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated it would be really helpful to do this work with a gottman or emotionally focused couples therapist gottmans the science of trust and what makes love last would both be helpful reference books to guide you along,1,1,489
1491,im currently dating someone else and i really like him but i love and miss my ex so much what do i do,relationships,finding the right person is a tricky thing to do why did you and your ex break up  months ago in relationships with others you get to see a reflection of yourself sometimes you may enjoy that reflection other times it may not feel so good im not sure where you are in your life and relationships and what you do from here depends on what you desire more of in your life but im not simply talking in the moment desire im referring to the direction you want your life to go if one of these guys was to support youwho would help you reach your dreams and who would you enjoy spending time with its complicated and no one can answer the what to do question but you slow down tune into your heart listen,1,1,698
1492,we have been fighting a lot and have  kids but we both want to stay together i need some help to save our family,relationships,hello i do not live in the california area however perhaps i could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling first i must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues including family issues if your girlfriend lives with you most insurances now cover livein partners as well if you have insurance contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is includedaside from insurance the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation do you belong to a church or other religious organization many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling these services are ordinarily offered free of charge to membersanother option might be to explore support groups within the area there may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group if you find there are no such groups in your area there are anonymous support groups online here is one such site httprelationshipsupportgroupscom,1,1,1147
1493,i find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about how do i figure out what triggers me to do this and how do i help overcome this problem i would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation,relationships,well lets start with the awesome realization youve already had you want to notice that you have triggers thats huge really i find that when people lie its most often as a defense mechanism which is likely a flag that something doesnt feel safe what exactly doesnt feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that its that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you it could really help to explore this with therapist perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty  thats not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers,1,1,689
1494,i have dog obsession disorder and i am having problems with my girlfriend because i am placing more importance to my two dogs over her how do i get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs,relationships,hey dogs are cool they adore pleasing humans and often love to work on learning what you want and expect from them your girlfriend on the other hand likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours you are good with dogs that tells me that youve spent some time observing their behavior the first step in working through this issue would be similar start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building the skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching and keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships,1,1,702
1495,hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why i love him very very much he sometimes thinks im obsessed when im not at all i give him his space and i make sure hes okay but sometimes i think if me and him saw each other more it would be better i truly want me and him to get better its kind of hard not to stress about it because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling hes a great guy i just dont know why hes been losing feelings towards me hes starting to put less effort in talking to me at this point ill do anything to just make us better as a couple i tried talking to him but he doesnt like talking about it much advice on what to do,relationships,im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear but id suggest giving him space ooph thats a tough one right i know but heres the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away he needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship its the work of being in relationship to learn this i get that this is tough stuff i wonder outside of being with him how do you soothe and calm yourself thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now,1,1,550
1496,we do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says how can i fix things,relationships,being able to accept your partners influence is a key relationship skill and its very two sided  chances are if you dont feel your partner is being influenced by you they likely dont feel you are being influenced by them either the best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence  play with it,1,1,368
1497,i havent uttered one word to my boyfriend in days now im over it and dont know how to approach the situation,relationships,in any relationship it is important to be able to say im sorry because it shows vulnerability and openness i recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future if you find yourself becoming upset again i encourage you to take a  minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hearunderstand what your partner is trying to convey,1,1,597
1498,i am a heterosexual male in my late s i find myself wearing pantyhose heels skirts and other womens clothing in private i am torn on how to feel about it i enjoy it very much i have had a pantyhosestocking fascination and other kinky fetish interests since i was young i have no history of sexual abuse growing up i am currently single,lgbtq,let yourself enjoy crossdressingwhat sounds in your way are whatever beliefs you gre up hearing see and absorb currentlyconcentrate on your own satisfaction and that you are doing this in a nonharming waymaybe if you branch out your interest by finding other people who enjoy crossdressing as much as you dowith any interest or activity social interaction supports it,1,1,367
1501,after  years of being straight how could i now find myself interested in people of the same sex i have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing,lgbtq,i frequently work with individuals who develop samesex attraction later in life humans have a tendency to think of things in absolutes black or white good or bad gay or straight in fact much of life is lived in the grey that lies in between the extremes this is especially true of sexual orientation which is fluid and occurs along a spectrum as someone ages and grows their sexual interests may change i would encourage you to speak to a therapist who specializes in working with lgbtq individuals they will have the experience necessary to help you navigate these issues,1,1,572
1510,im a girl and i cant tell whether im bisexual or gay i like girls a little more than boys but i dont really know,lgbtq,i think longevity has a lot to do with arriving at a clear answerits ok to not know and while you dont know read join groups which discuss the topic and most valuable pay attention to the way you actually feel around girls how being approached and approaching girls feels and whether this feels about the same as when you are around boyseventually the question will answer itselftry to avoid deciding a conclusion until your heart feels ready to tell you a clear answer,1,1,469
1513,what should i do when we see each other,lgbtq,i am so sorry this happened  sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful  i might suggest depending on your relationship reaching out to your sister and discussing this or setting boundary that you dont want to discuss your private life  i might also speak with your wife and share how hurt you are and what you need to happen moving forward to begin to heal,1,1,392
1516,i was born a girl i look like a boy i sometimes feel like a different variation of gender i dont know what to say if someone asks my gender i just get really confused and usually say my birth gender,lgbtq,hi as an affirming gender therapist i like to let people know that like sexuality gender is a spectrum too  its possible to look like a girl and feel more like a boy just as its possible to feel halfway between a boy and a girl or anywhere else on a horizontal line with two points between it  some people use different pronouns or words to express their gender and thats okay  its up to you to find out what is most comfortable,1,1,428
1519,ive been going through a rough time lately i been into nothing but women ive never thought about men until a week ago im very upset and depressed about this its not normal to me i looked at gay porn more than once to prove that im not gay i get the same results each time and i feel disgust this is tough on me im scared that i looked too many times i keep thinking about it and shake all the time,lgbtq,are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gaywhether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up and your own tolerance for being a unique individualexamining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effortthe more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it,1,1,596
1520,i have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now this issue has persisted for  years already but i dont know where to start i do not have the soundest information either,lgbtq,wonderful  i am so excited for you  what a huge decision  i am writing from toronto canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically  i would start with two things  find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and  find a counsellor or therapist that is transgender specialized  they will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well  google is a wonderful way to find these resources   i wish you well thanks for writing,1,1,475
1521,in middle school and high school my friends and family thought i was gay i tried telling them but they wouldnt believe me it almost feels like they wanted me to be now im actually starting to believe them i know i wasnt back then and now im not sure anymore,lgbtq,use this time to explore who you areimagine what your life would be like if you were gay and not ask yourself what is different what scenario do you find yourself gravitating to  what is important is that you are happy my message to you is that you do not need to define yourself with your sexual preference or feel the need to label yourself especially if you are confused and exploring what your sexual preference is,1,1,418
1522,im a guy if i dont like girls nor do i like guys does that mean im gay,lgbtq,it doesnt sound like you are finding yourself attracted to anyone  it could mean that you just havent connected with anyone you find attractive or that you are asexual  essentially not oriented toward anyone  i would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel,1,1,296
1524,"im transgender i know i am but ive only told a few friends i know i cant tell my family because of previous conversations weve had they just wouldnt accept it
 my gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own i need some strategies for dealing with it what should i do",lgbtq,hi it can be difficult to handle such a transition on your own i work with clients to understand their needs and wants this can involve how to communicate effectively with friends family and other loved ones or learning how to have selfacceptance i strongly recommend speaking with a licensed clinician one on one to help facilitate the change you are looking for,1,1,363
1526,i have been noticing myself really enjoying watchingreading about gay or lesbian couples ive also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl and i like the idea i also find guys cute too does this make me bisexual,lgbtq,hello  thank you for your question  exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself  i would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi what messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations,1,1,356
1527,im a teenage girl i dont know if im straight bisexual or gay ive been straight all my life but a sudden rush of questions have come over me and i dont know anymore,lgbtq,being open minded about the type of sexual connection which feels true and real is a solid starting pointhaving questions is a very valuable way of more clearly defining your sexualitywrite one or two of your questions if youd like a more specific focus to your general search about your sexual preference,1,1,305
1529,ive recently thought that i could be transgender but ive never had the mind of a girl,lgbtq,hello frostproofthinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different  this is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in lgbtq issues  from what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling system  while labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify they can also feel restrictive or confining  instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you  there are many options for you to find a therapist and etherapy is also an option  you can try breakthrough an online service   here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful  yin yang woman man httpdldbzejvk  what does it mean to be a woman or a man,1,1,858
1530,i feel like i would be more comfortable as a girl even though i still like girls i think im like a girl stuck in a guy body i imagine myself as a girl too i think this more because my friends say that if i was a girl i would be a hot looking one and i dont care about having boobs or anything i just feel like the way that i do act will make more sense if i was a girl,lgbtq,gender is personal thing  there is not just boy and girl  it is ok to be a boy and feel feminine and date women  it is also ok to be a transgendered women and date women  have fun with it and feel it out  what is right for you,1,1,226
1531,often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me once it starts the thought continues going through my head and i cant get it out how can i stop these thoughts,behavioralchange,"you are
valid   it is very unnerving when thoughts control your life 
one way to combat them is to figure out whose voice the words are said in
oftentimes people say things to us and it stays with us and it is not often
true  we let others opinions penetrate our brains and live rentfree in
our heads  you could try to rewrite the thoughts the negative thoughts
rewrite them in a positive way   for example you are not worth
anything you could rewrite that in a way that shows all the ways you are
worthy  write all your accomplishments and things you have overcome and
proof that you are in fact worthy because you are  you can 
interrupt the thought focus redirect elsewhere if you are replaying a
specific moment you could go back into that moment and retell the moment
rewrite the moment so that it is what you would rather it have been your mind
does not know anything other than what we feed it feed and integrate more
positive thoughts and actions into your routine to possibly see a positive
change a change for the better this video could be beneficial for you  negotiating with inner critic",1,1,1115
1535,ive tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables but i always seem to eat the junk in the house,behavioralchange,maybe you need more motivation to avoid eating the junk in your housealso if you are the only person in your household who eats healthy eating differently from everyone else may seem less funtry creating your own world of a healthy culture through social media because this may give you a sense of not being alone in your effort in healthy living,1,1,346
1537,im a teenager and i created a sort of imaginary friend to help me cope with stressful situations or if im worried or upset she gives me advice and comforts me and tells me itll be okay ive given her a name solace and created a personality for her thats like a comforting motherly figure i know its just my own advice and my own thoughts but its just that im thinking of them through a voice other than my own i do this because i know i never really listen to my own advice and i thought it would be better if it was through someone else who knew my thought process in and out through this imaginary friend is this normal could it develop into a separate personality with time if i continue a mentality that she is her own person,behavioralchange,from your detailed awareness of how you developed and are utilizing solace unless you face some unexpected and altering physical incident to your brain such as physical head trauma drug induced brain change other medical condition which affects your brain you show a strong knowledge that she is imaginary and not a personthe predicted outcome of what you wrote is to continue the selfreflective conversations you have with your invented friend solace,1,1,451
1540,my daughter basically freaked out out of nowhere over me saying calm down when she dropped her phone within seconds the situation escalated to her kicking me out on the curb saying horrifically unspeakable things and her calling the cops on me she seems unable to stop herself at times,behavioralchange,bipolar disorder has a lot of different components if this is a onetime event it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to calm down may have made her feel as though you werent understanding what she was saying bipolar disorder also includes feelings of depression when this is coupled with intense anger and acting or speaking without thinking these can be part of bipolar disorder but that wouldnt be the whole picture of what bipolar disorder would look like it may be helpful to track differences that you notice in your daughters mood and any patterns related to the times of day or what seems to lead her to be upset patterns are very helpful in figuring out what is happening,1,1,731
1542,one moment im happy and then a tiny thing happens and i feel so hurt and awful that i cant handle anything i cry and cry then next morning im happy im so confused,behavioralchange,probably there are deeper more delicate topics beneath the surfaceif people dont address their pain despair shame fears and instead store them up eventually the pile up leads to the situation you describegive yourself the time to reflect on who you are your priorities values people who may have injured your feelings in the pastthe greater your selfunderstanding becomes the less likely some small insignificant matter has the chance to topple the house of cards,1,1,463
1543,i read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms is that correct,behavioralchange,it is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always rightif you ignore the person then their thinking is that there is something wrong with youignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship will spare you to be misunderstood further,1,1,296
1544,i suffer from checking and cleaning ocd can counseling help me to get over it,behavioralchange,absolutely  exposure techniques in counseling have shown to be extremely effective for working through compulsions  first thing i would say is to make sure you feel a good connection with your counselor and you feel its a good fit  its hard to get through that anxiety already but having a counselor that feels right for you will help to buffer that a bit and help guide you through the exposuresnot sure what kind of access you have in your area but some counselors that specialize in exposure therapy will actually come to you to support you through an exposure  its very treatable so just take it a step at a time and hang in there,1,1,634
1546,i realized my boyfriend of seven years is a psychopath and i want to understand how he thinks,behavioralchange,good questioni have only a guess to itpsychopaths feel no empathy and all the emotions which are based on caring about someone elsethis means they feel no guilt no joy no drive to connect w othersitd be unusual if your bf is really a psychopath bc if he was then hed be using and abusing you trying to control you for his benefitunless you actually do suffer in these ways then to consider him a psychopath may be exaggerated,1,1,425
1547,i cant understand what i pay attention to,behavioralchange,one way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention backstart with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate  youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer onesonce you start seeing your success this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentratethe task of selfreminding is the same whether for long or short time periodsalso before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problemif there is then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate and not some medical reason preventing thisbefore someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work,1,1,856
1548,im a teenager and ive been sneaking out of my house at night for a year now ive been caught several times i want to stop doing this but i dont know where to start how do i stop,behavioralchange,ive talked to many teens who frequently sneak out the question i always ask them is what are you getting from sneaking out that you arent getting at home many teens answer they are hooking up using substances and engaging in other risky behaviors as uncomfortable as it might be i encourage you to talk with your parents or guardians about the reasons why you are sneaking out what are you getting out there that you arent getting at home a good family counselor can help sort through those issues good luck,1,1,507
1554,im a teenager and i get these really intense mood swings    my mood will be really high and ill think of something that i want to do when i start to make it happen i get irritated by other people if they intervene then if the thing i wanted to do doesnt work out i have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out    can you explain whats going on,behavioralchange,mood swings and getting frustrated when things dont work out is totally normal sometimes we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesnt work out this said youre coming to counselchat and so im guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about if this is getting in the way of your life it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on while for most people frustrationmood swings is related to typical life and stress if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like bipolar disorder where a persons mood and energy might fly so high mania that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted note there is a lot more to bipolar disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis wish you well,1,1,1012
1556,for the past four weeks ive been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things theyre not random voices but rather the voices of those i care about,behavioralchange,i would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going throughi dont know if you can understand when the voices are saying but i wonder how you feel about what you are hearing if the voices are just at night is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream if you recall your nightmares consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patternsone thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room youre in for example take time to notice your feet on the floor hips in the chair and shoulders against the back of the chair you can also try mindfulness techniques such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns these ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near youthanks for reaching out,1,1,976
1560,my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one i neglected to ask how this was different than an episode i have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type ,behavioralchange,i do not think there is such a thing as a psychotic seizure however there is something called a pseduoseizure or psychogenic nonepileptic seizure basically this is when a person shows signs of a fullon seizure such as falling and convulsing but they are not producing brain waves consistent with a seizure psedoseizures tend to be brought on by high stress emotional challenges and trauma history you can learn more here httpswwwncbinlmnihgovbooksnbk still the best way to now what your doctor meant would be to ask them ,1,1,521
1563,people always judge others so rudely,behavioralchange,i agree with you and this is emotionally painful to watch or be on the receiving sidedepending on who is the person doing this and your relationship to them it is possible to kindly point out that the person may unnecessarily hurt someones feelingsif you express your thoughts and give your guidance then whatever the person does afterwards you have the peace of knowing you tried to redirect this behavior,1,1,406
1564,ive developed a really intense and unexpected attraction to an actress after seeing her in a ballet uniform while guest starring on a television show i try but i cant get her out of my mind what should i do,behavioralchange,why not make good use of your unexpected attraction to study the features you consider attractive in someoneattraction based on physicality is normal  as long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel and so long as your attraction isnt stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people then eventually it will lose its power on you,1,1,514
1565,i know im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life but i just cant seem to even though i really want to why cant i force myself to change,behavioralchange,in general the reason people arent able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to changewhat the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotionsif you havent got someone like this in your life which is common then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they arebe patient with yourself too  change sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change,1,1,637
1566,i dont feel like myself anymore for example i could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving i feel like im watching my life be lived by someone else,behavioralchange,you may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization  people with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance or may not recognize their image in the mirror  dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic  i would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own  on my website i have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful  best of luck to you,1,1,580
1567,"i was with my friends fishing by a pond i found a frog and stabbed it with my friends knife im not sure why i did it my friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me
   now if someone brings it up i get really upset and panicked i dont know why i feel like this does this mean there is something wrong with me",behavioralchange,the good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you   im glad you have awareness and im glad you are not at ease with killing frogsfairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violencebasically you did unto the frog what someone has or to you feels like has been done to youuse your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain   reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you   it is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realizedstabbing innocent frogs is wrong  it is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably haveit is also wrong that someone close to you hurt youthe direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships,1,1,949
1568,sometimes when i look at my pet cat i think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him it makes me sad because i love him but i always think about how helpless he is thereve even been splitseconds where i felt almost tempted to kick him followed by shame and guilt,behavioralchange,a lot of different things could be happening here do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is if you have not actually kicked him then i would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him what else is thereit would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you it could be that you feel safe with your cat so strong emotions come up because you feel safe,1,1,502
1569,she was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it she has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home we do not understand what is going on and it is driving us crazy,behavioralchange,there are many possible answers here it could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable or dozens of other things will she talk about it when shes not mad you mentioned that she has an attachment issue it could also be that she was attached to the house its not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot,1,1,409
1570,ive felt this way for two years i feel so much better now then i did when it started but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times,behavioralchange,best answer that i can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone it will come and go throughout life kind of like being on a rollercoaster here it is then its gone not to return for quite some time like many things the more that you fixate on it the more stress it will cause you consider it part of life accept it and move on now if your having many many many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at but for the most part nothing to worry about hope this helpsc,1,1,629
1571,i just need to know if im really crazy or not,behavioralchange,do an internet research on psychosis symptoms and see if you have several of the symptoms  if you do seek a medical evaluation from your primary care physician  there are great medications and psychotherapy that can help you live your life to the fullest  there a many people who are diagnosed with psychosis and living a productive life,1,1,337
1572,i start to think of an issue that doesnt even matter or something bad that happened years ago then i cry pull at my hair plug my ears hit myself and throw things in loud public places i get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody i have an awful fear of people leaving me which normally ends up happening and i feel like im too clingy,behavioralchange,there is a reason you are having breakdowns i cant agree that they happen for no reason at all   finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past uncover hurtful experiences or recognize something that would be extremely pain  however if you dont find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you may confront the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse  there is a light at the end of the road but you need some help to find the right road to get on so you can see it,1,1,569
1573,"i have an exboyfriend who just lies about everything he is super lazy he lies to everyone that he has a good job builds trust and then start borrowing moneyand large amounts too it has come to the point where he has gone through several group of friends he is leaving a trail behind full of friends in debt because he would put on a sob story borrow money then disappear he refuses to work so he sits at home playing games all day and either lies to his mom for money or lies to his friends i used to think his lying was due to his drug habit but now im hearing from other exfriends of his that this started even before the drugs got into his life he would borrow anywhere from  to  from everyone and it would all disappear hes in debt with bills he doesnt gamble but he spends his money on random stuff
   although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money he seems to be a good person hell always give a homeless person all his change no matter what my brother has epilepsy and is really antisocialmy exboyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother he takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him he drives me to school and work every day and picks me upjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that hes not totally a horrible human being is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there",behavioralchange,it sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out you notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another one question that i would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist another question i would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him,1,1,858
1574,i noticed lately that ive been thinking a lot about death i dont want to die and im not suicidal i just think about what would happen if i died or if someone i loved died i imagine how sad everyone i know would be i know it isnt worth it and i definitely want to live and have a future i just think about it when im driving i sometimes imagine what would happen if i just let go of the wheel and kept going,behavioralchange,ill respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving youll end up quite seriously hurt at the very least   it is fine to play in your mind with what ifs   people who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositionsif you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on deathsince you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in youplay around with your idea as to why youd consider how people will feel about you if youre not in their livesthis may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others,1,1,947
1575,i was never like this recently this year my first year of high school i started getting emotional for no reason,behavioralchange,hello vancouver its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes the small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke if theres anger there look underneath that is it powerlessness worthlessness hurt shame  then ask yourself when in your life youve experienced too much of that feeling as a child maybe but not necessarily thats the first step and combined with empathy compassion and selfesteem youre starting to build what i call an emotional air conditioner a good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily i wish you the best,1,1,947
1576,i am lazy i am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time but i never seem to shake the habits i try to think of what it is doing to me and my future but no matter what i keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination all im ever left with is regrets and a low grade i am at an alltime low in my life and im not even that old ive always been a straighta student but now im getting cs and fs and it hurts me to know that i am way better than that its not even like the work is hard,behavioralchange,possibly laziness is not the true problem and is only what appears as the problemsince you describe your laziness as an observable quality i assume youve not always felt or handled yourself this wayquite possibly and more likely the particular conditions of your current life are not ones that are optimal for feeling good about yourself and your involvementsone suggestion is to see if there is any purpose to what youre doing in all the areas in which you see yourself acting from lazinessif youre not able to notice any good purpose then you may be mistaking laziness for a significant amount of stress in your lifestress can be opened and understood  if stress is what underlies what appears as laziness then you define the contributors to your stressnot feeling enough support in your life financial uncertainty arguments w people who are close in your life feeling misunderstood overall or by particular people all are possibilitiesgood luck in learning more about who you are,1,1,982
1577,i never get infections or scars or anything and it doesnt bother me if it gets filled up with blood or something but im concerned,behavioralchange,hi houston the fact that youre concerned says a lot if i was your therapist id ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life youre causing perhaps permanent changes damage to your body and its likely youre trying to express somethingpain maybe a therapist can help you to explore whats going on for you and how to get your needs for selfexpression met in a more healthy way good luck,1,1,421
1578,i feel that i am struggling with undiagnosed bipolar disorder and it is making my daytoday life extremely difficult,behavioralchange,it sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of distress and youre wondering if it may meet a diagnosis of bipolar disorder there are a few different types of bipolar diagnoses in the dsm diagnositc and statistical manual and the best way to find out if your experiences would meet that diagnosis would be to meet with a mental health professional you can also look up the diagnosis online and see if what you are going through meets the criteriaone question that i would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out that you meet the criteria for such a diagnosis it sounds like whether or not you do you are suffering and working with a therapist may help you get into a better place,1,1,699
1579,this is my recovery and i dont feel that it is okay for them to ask this they told me it is policy due to the fact that i may run into a peer there i am a peer counselor in the small community that i grew up in i am in recovery myself i was asked to come work for this organization after i was two years sober i was in treatment in this organization i work with mental health peers and run life skill groups i dont work with substance peers,addiction,you definitely want to make sure not to inadvertently create an inappropriate dual relationship with a client in fact it is not uncommon for state regulatory boards to determine that a clinician and client being in the same  step group is professional misconduct you might want to consider attending a  step meeting that is located in a different community than the one you work in  another option would be to look for oneonone or small group recovery support,1,1,459
1581,for some reason i look at my phone and in no time five hours has passed during those five hours im playing games and trying to find out how to make my phone fun to use so i dont feel like i wasted my time trying to improve my phones performance in my life,addiction,start by spending small amounts of time with your own thoughts and feelingsalways being focused on what a phone offers keeps people at a distance from knowing themselvesas long as you make time to spend in an activity which is not interactive the way a phone is and instead depends only upon your actions you will be investing time and energy into your own lifewhether by consciously considering your own interests or doing housecleaning or chores by devoting yourself to areas which you decide to be involved in you will increase your knowledge of your own intereststhen to not be so involved with your phone will be natural and easy,1,1,634
1582,"i have a relative who is in his twenties he was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again no one informed family that he was using drugs again he subsequently overdosed and was found dead
 is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed is there a legal case for failing to report",addiction,im so sorry to hear of your loss  this sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws i would suggest talking with a local attorney  that being said i see two competing issues here  on the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative  on the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm  generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesa local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation,1,1,713
1584,i terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago i am now realizing that i would like to begin counseling again the social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in  hours but he hasnt called me back i called him on the weekend and made it clear that i want him to call me back can he just ignore me,legalregulatory,mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients  this is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller  in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youin addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards  for example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within  hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promiseall that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too it is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlyin the end i agree with sherrys advice if you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit,1,1,999
1586,what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation,legalregulatory,this sounds like a potentially serious situation the most important thing is to make sure the child is safe  if you suspect that a child is or has been harmed i would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to child protective services if you dont think that a child is in danger you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board,1,1,411
1587,they discontinued treatment for no apparent reason after they thought to diagnose me with schizophrenia,legalregulatory,the general rule against medical abandonment says thst whenever healthcare providers discontinue treatment with you when you still need it they are legally required to make sure that you have access to another provider of equal or higher abilityin this case if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment if you havent already done so id recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral,1,1,550
1588,i had a dispute with my therapist regarding an appointment cancellation now she is blocking me from seeing other psychologists at the same clinic which takes my insurance which is also where i get my psychiatric services there is a strict  hour cancellation policy and my appointments are at  on tuesday i called to cancel at  the previous friday i was late so we contacted my doctor to tell her that i would be out of town she said i could do a phone in session the thing is we do double sessions,legalregulatory,my recommendation would be to try to talk to your therapist about this  from your description it sounds like you have a legitimate explanation for missing your scheduled session maybe if you could explain that to her she would be willing to work with you if she is not willing to consider your explanation and if she is not willing to continue working with you she still has an ethical obligation to provide you with referral resources to another therapist,1,1,456
1589,i think i have depression anxiety bipolar disorder and i have anger issues i told my mom over and over again she told me she would get me a therapist but she never did i just found out that my mom cant afford a therapist for me,legalregulatory,it can be difficult to get counseling if you dont feel supported by family members  there might be a few options  if you are in school id recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse  they often will be able to help you access free or affordable counseling resources in your community  in addition depending on where you live its also often possible to call  for referrals to free or low cost counseling services in your areaid encourage you not to give up you are on the right track,1,1,494
1590,i have major depression severe ptsd anxiety disorder and personality disorder i had an appointment with my doctor i was very upset and i shared with him about that particular drug,legalregulatory,your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist  especially if your doctor is concerned about your safetyit was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on  i know that must have been difficult to talk about with him  by having that conversation you are helping your primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your health,1,1,406
1591,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,there are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated client has met therapy goals client is not progressing  therapist is not a good fit for clientin order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what isnt and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client in these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea,1,1,1000
1604,"my therapist is gay so there are no sexual issues here however my therapist for six years has made me believe that he cares about me and that we are friends i have loaned money to him many times and he always paid me back
   i had a medical emergency last weekend and i was heavily medicated i knew that this therapist came into my home and wrote down my credit card information so he could pay back what he owed me but this therapist dropped me off and never came again i dont know what to do",professionalethics,im sorry to hear that this has happened counselors are legally and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests in addition counselor ethical rules and the laws in just about every state make it illegal for counselors to take advantage of a client financially a counselor borrowing money from a client even if the counselor pays it back would usually be considered to be taking advantage of the clientthere are a few options you have at this point if you cant or dont want to continue to try to contact him directly you can file a complaint with your states regulatory board and let them know what has happened  an investigator will then look into the situation for you  another option would be for you to find a different counsleor who can provide you with an independent and netural point of view to help you figure out how you want to handle this situation,1,1,924
1606,i just wanted to get to know one so i can hear about their college experience and the courses they took i also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school,professionalethics,its a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing regarding the length of schooling it generally takes  years of college and an additional  to  years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist there are also other similar professions including counseling that dont require a doctorate degree licensed counselors generally completed  years of college and an additional  years of graduate school if you are thinking about a career in psychology the local apa chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to heres a link to the nj apa chapterhttpswwwpsychologynjorg,1,1,698
1607,i am an international student and it is my first semester in graduate school in the united states i faced a cultural shock and i was so depressed when i arrived here my counselor in the university was my savior he helped me a great deal now i am going back to my country for a vacation i was thinking to get him something special with my countrys name on it and i remembered that he likes wine my country is known for that is it appropriate to give him wine as a gift after christmas,professionalethics,this is a great question in general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients there are some exceptions to this general rule  including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift givingit might be best to simply offer your counselor a holiday card as an expression of your feelings you could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriatein the end i know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you,1,1,532
1610,i have an eating disorder of binging ive had gastric sleeve surgery i need help with issues of abuse as a child addiction and abusive men i have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist,professionalethics,it can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you needmy recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel specifically tell your counselor that you dont seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would likeif this doesnt help then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you,1,1,397
1611,im worried i should see a therapist due to past events and current mental status im just so unsure of how to ask my doctor about seeing someone,professionalethics,having this kind of conversation with a doctor can feel difficult but remember you are the expert on you any good medical professional will recognize thatyou are absolutely right to think about the importance of being your own health care advocate generally the best approach is simply to be honest let your doctor know what you are concerned about and tell your doctor what you think might help if there is a specific issue that youd like to address in counseling let you doctor know about it and dont hesitate to directly ask for a referrali know this may all feel a little overwhelming it might help to bring a family member or significantother with you to provide support when you talk to your doctor its great that youve already taken this first step to reach out youre on the right track,1,1,793

1623,i am a young adult and i was sexually assaulted by an older man when i was a teenager which has really intensified the guiltshame however ive been attracted to much older men since i was even younger than that,humansexuality,sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distantif you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know youd have liked more and didnt receive this then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within youit is ok to like older menjust be sure youre not idealizing them or anyone elsebecause regardless of age a relationship is based on who the two people really are not how wed like imagining them,1,1,473
1624,back in high school my friend and i used to masturbate around each other i hate even talking about it now because its so weird we didnt even realize how messed up it was at the time one time it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other it wasnt supposed to be a gay thing but it sure sounds like it now that i talk about it i pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again im having a lot of trouble,humansexuality,writing about your high school masturbation times with your friend is itself a form of acknowledging the full picture of who you are   you are doing well to reflect on your actions in the truthful way you are doingalso positive is that you have perspective that at your age and social maturity you were innocently doing something that in adult terms would be considered in a negative waymaybe through your more mature minds eye of today you can feel some compassion and understanding for your high school self  this way your sense of selfjudgment may start to dissolve a little bit more,1,1,586

1630,these jokes are made about everything they seem to have the need to say something funny about everything its not funny just awkward,socialrelationships,i agree it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all  and if a person only jokes then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer this can also be quite tediousrealize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression  you could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave,1,1,386
1631,its really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who dont put any effort into nourishing our relationship,socialrelationships,one thing i would ask is why are you still hanging with those friends a relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people i would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends i always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved if your in a relationship that is onesided it is inevitable that it will start to decompensate never travel with the circus never travel with fools everything in life should have some positive payout will things at times be negative of course they will but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativityhope this helps c,1,1,706
1632,because we are on opposite coasts we try to talk early mornings but she is constantly interrupted by visitors i suggested setting aside some time but she has made it very clear she has no intention of changing her lifestyle she is also drinking beer every day on antipsychotics,socialrelationships,the answer depends on how satisfied and happy you feel in being part of this friendshipfrom what you write there arent any statements as to what gives you happiness about being a friend to this personsince you already made a request of your friend and she isnt following through you could ask if she is willing to work with your suggested planthe friendship may take a new format depending on your friends responseits possible to be in contact more spontaneously when either of you feel like contacting the otherwhat matters most is your own dissatisfaction with the current relationship statuseven if you change to a birthday and holiday only conversation or some other style of interacting at least it will be the result of the effort from each person not just one who is you designing arrangements which only you are willing to keep,1,1,835
1633,my best friend and i were pranking her friend and i told her to tell him that she likes him she said no but i forced her after she told him he told her that he likes her too their friendship is ruined because of me she wont forgive me and i feel really guilty i feel like crying,socialrelationships,in order for your friend to forgive you shed need to trust you understand the damage you introduced into her relationship with her friendits possible if you offer your friend expressions of your empathy toward her  over an extended time possibly shell forgive youyoure certainly learning relationship lessons on how to treat people and the effect of betraying another person which will last forevermaybe this was meant to be the outcome,1,1,436
1634,i was mentored by this guy for a few years spiritually it was okay at times but other times it was just weird i try not to think about it too much but a lot of manipulation and lying happened yet no one else really believed me when i told them its like hes two different people and no one else really sees that side of him i was blamed for a lot of our troubles and now we dont really talk much im worried because hes in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything they just think im attacking his character how do i know for sure,socialrelationships,you may intuitively be sensing what many professionals in the social sciences and psychology have already understoodjust google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these rolestheoretically is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths  well yes  and i consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people  being able to recognize social dynamics is a strength that you havepsychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopathsi agree with you about not being able to change peoples minds who are attached to this persons interactionsthe only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity and you have evidence of this that you contact relevant authoritiesno one is allowed to break laws including psychopaths,1,1,1022
1636,she mostly targets me on social media the bullying used to be much worse but it is still going on the comments are so vague but i know that they are meant for me even when i confront her she messages me short phrases to try to get in my head if i try to fight back she will ruin me,socialrelationships,sorry to hear of your problem situation  feeling intimidated by another person is very unsettlingstop having contact with the personbullies only interact with others either by intimidating someone or by themselves feeling intimidated by someonebullies do not have the same dynamics as everyone elseno one can convince or persuade or talk a bully out of their behaviorthe best protection for yourself assuming you are not being physically threatened by the person is to close contact with themthis does not take away any of the disappointment or sadness of wishing for a better relationship with the personuntil the bully wants to interact differently with others only harm can result from contact with themstep one is to stop the bleeding then to assess and learn to live with not having the person in your life,1,1,811
1637,im having problems shutting them out and putting up walls,socialrelationships,it sounds like you would like to let other people get close to you and at the same time you are finding yourself compelled to keep people at a distance often times when we have difficulty trusting others it is because we have specific fears about what would happen if we get close or let our guard down such fears may be rooted in past experiences in relationships in which we were hurt and or disappointed in working with a therapist you can gain insight into what is underneath your compulsion to put walls around yourself and develop ways to form authentic lasting satisfying relationships with others,1,1,604
1638,im having a quinceañera and the girls dont like their dresses they never told me and now its a week away i dont know what to do,socialrelationships,how did you find out that the girls arent happy with their dressesdid you hear this directly from one of them or is this third hand information that someone else told you about one of the girls in your partythe answer matters because gossiping instead of directly telling you about a problem is a problem in itselfi suggest a conversation with the entire group of girls in which you tell them how you actually are feeling about their opinions about the dressesone topic you may consider bringing up is what everyone expects to get out of the party  are they coming because they like one another and wearing a dress in which the girl is happy is only one way of having fun togetheryou may learn a great deal as to the difference in values about a quinceaña among you and your friendsi hope youll have a fun party,1,1,811
1639,i would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present,socialrelationships,take one day at a time  each day do things that make you happy moves to a positive place focusing on the future give you a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment  journal at the end of the day of how well you did that day in focusing on these things  each day should be a step better than the previous day  you will have days that you didnt do as wellthat is human and ok  just get back on track the next dayat the end of the week review how well you did and give your self a grade  if did well you deserve ice cream etc  if not so good oktell yourself next week got to focus one day at a time  you can do itit takes practice but will get better each day  i wish you happy days and happy future,1,1,695
1641,in this argument my friends are all against me so im wondering if im exaggerating my feelings i feel like im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim when in reality im the one being unreasonable and i am simply annoying my reasonable friends or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship,socialrelationships,conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in every one of our relationships what im reading is that you find yourself in a loop of  seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself am i right if you arent validating yourself no one else will be able to either  try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing  and then if you are still feeling vulnerable share that too,1,1,536
1642,theyre calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as i do im tired of being called names what should i do,socialrelationships,it sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct communication is key to any relationship i would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded if after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly especially if this friendship is valuable to you however make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them on the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship not all friendships are healthy ones and it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder iti hope you are able to get this matter sorted best of luck,1,1,1199
1643,"i nanny a three year old when he wakes up in the morning he calls out for someone to come get him if i am the one to go get him out of bed he gets really upset and refuses to let me near him he screams that he wants his mom or dad they work from home    the rest of the day he loves me but not in the mornings
   what can i do",childrenadolescents,it doesnt sound like he hates you just misses mom and dad in the mornings you could validate his feelings by saying something like i know you want to see mom and dad right now but they are working and then give him a couple options of things that may take his mind off of it this could be choosing what he has for breakfast or playing a game of his choice if possible it may also be helpful if you could create a routine in which he stops by mom and dad to say good morning if this is routine he will come to understand that he will be able to see mom and dad for a minute and not become anxious about seeing them,1,1,613

1652,"i keep having these random thoughts that i dont want things like you arent worth anything i know theyre my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it
   what is wrong with me and how can i stop having these thoughts",diagnosis,i think we all go through a period of time where we think we arent worth anything sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame the most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality i dont feel worth anything but i know what i do is important i know who i am matters to others i know i am loved and cared aboutwhen you find yourself having these thoughts stop take a few deep breaths and try to reframe what youre thinking,1,1,489
1663,how do therapists classify the type of personality their clients have what characteristics do they look at to decide what type of personality the client has ive read about this online but id like to understand this from a therapists point of view,diagnosis,this is a great question and i am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach when i am determining what type of personality a client has i take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person and building rapport after taking time to get to know them and learning about their view they have of themselves and others it is important to pickup on more specific personality traits which comprehensively contribute to a personality type clinicians including myself often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent which indicate a type of personality for example if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization needing to be on time planning and perfectionism these traits contribute to the type a personality in addition to utilizing clinical judgment clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the dsm icd,1,1,989
1667,"i empathize so much even with characters on tv or in video games that i actually feel physical pain this has made life difficult to say the least
   i believe i have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder but since its such a new disorder i cant find any information about it could this be what is going on with me",diagnosis,sometimes its helps to have a name for a problem  it can make you feel less alone as in oh theres a name for this and other people have this experience too on the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now i have a special problem that has a special name and thats an important part of who i ambottom line whether its a disorder or not you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other peoples energy and feelings you might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy just like the volume dial or button on the tv that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel whats going on but its not so loud you can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far this is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted,1,1,1189
1668,"how do you know you have the right therapist for you
 how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment",counselingfundamentals,find a therapist who is experienced in the issues that bring you to counseling when you interview your therapist or during the initial session you will want to share with the therapist what your expectations are for therapy share with them what you need for therapy to be helpful to you an important part of your first sessions will be setting specific goals for therapy with objectives on how those goals will be accomplished these are your goals not your therapists goals these goals and objectives should be written in a treatment plan and shared with you for approval you are welcome to make changes in your treatment at any time,1,1,633
1748,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,absolutely its normal to cry in therapy sessions sometimes clients have stories they never shared with anyone or never said out loud and that results to crying crying is a normal reaction to feeling hurt or sad or sometimes angry i welcome all crying to my therapy room,1,1,269
1813,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,yes counseling provides an area for people to speak to an unbiased professional about their concerns to address their unique needs while length of time varies counseling is a process and can be done from as little as one session to multiple sessions counseling provide a safe nonjudgmental empathetic atmosphere from a professional helper provide the service,1,1,358
1831,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,hello there are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone  its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away you may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for youregardless of how you go about it i like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back there are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits you,1,1,882
1851,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,i think this question can vary based on the individual therapist their style and theoretical orientation clients are always welcome to ask questions before and during the process to understand their care when i am first meeting with a client i take a more formalized approach in our first session completing what is called a psychosocial assessment typically i explore what brought the client to therapy in the first place and i take a more direct approach asking a variety of questions related to the specific struggles frequency history duration etc this is not how my normal therapy sessions are and i try to explain that to my clients so they understand that while my first initial sessions is a lot of information gathering and me typing out their responses on going therapy is very client focused and catered to the needs of the client,1,1,841
1859,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals,some basic skills are empathy you should feel heard and understood the therapist should keep the focus on you since counseling is about you and the issues your facing that being said if you feel like they are sharing too much its going okay to say this they should also be able to identify some coping skills to help you manage the symptoms your experiencing,1,1,358
1865,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,each client brings their own style they like to a coaching or counseling relationship  when i counseled and coached military i learned to relate to what style of coaching they seek  some were better at the drill sergeant style of coaching  or a liberal style integrative humanistic progressive or conservative  some can be obsessed and try and cross the line  when you are in the public eye it can be a bit much and you have to know what client is a good fit for your practice  some dont see you as human but we are  we seek to do the best we can with our knowledge cause it is a calling and i am sure others will say on here that we have to have our go to place of healing also so we can be good for our clients,1,1,712
1870,"i have secrets in my mind and i dont know what to do with them i dont want to tell my wife and mom because i dont want to hurt them but im not sure how long that i can keep the secret to myself

what should i do its becoming annoying and making me anxious help me out",family conflict,it sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now there are several things to consider before you make a decision you mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them  is it necessary for them to know this information what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves if your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel would you want to know the secrets how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthonce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not,1,1,933
1876,"ive known my boyfriend for several years we were friends for a long time in  we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state i planned to move in with him in  after i finished school and he found a job however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time we decided later to make it work shortly after i found out that i was pregnant i wanted to tell him during his next visit however he never came to see me and instead asked me for money after i gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts 

soon after i experienced a miscarriage i texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care i was extremely hurt by this i still decided to move back as i had originally planned he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him during this time i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know although he says he did i hardly ever see him he never got a job which was in the original plan  

after that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together once we got back together i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in i thought he had too but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman in fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her when i confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car i dont know what to do",relationshipsdomestic violence,there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life i think youll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect,1,1,739
1877,"i have been with my husband for almost  years we got engaged a little after  years of being together i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose 
when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned i was happy but i couldnt help feeling disappointed too
i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldnt help how i was feeling
we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds  i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted
i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding what i wanted will never happen
i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset
i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just cant control it its ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it plus i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed 
why cant i move on",marriage,its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either however like you know the marriage is the most important thing  how many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship i assure you that there are plenty try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired focus on what you can control now perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringi would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately but after that close that chapter and move on it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change,1,1,1097

is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way this is not a joke i am trying to understand",family conflict,hi this sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out my first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  as far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries be clear about the expectations of your home also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue i hope this helps you your family members and the pets,1,1,673

two summers ago we saw each other casually for a while but we never had sex then or while we were dating which was only for two months three years ago im now in my s and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his s despite the age difference i know were a really good match weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out i tell him everything also my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing that summer i told him i didnt want anything serious and broke it off only a week later he had gotten back together with his girlfriend his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited im sure she may be different around him but i worry about him committing to her in the long run theyre supposed to move in together soon but still i feel this connection with my exboyfriend and i feel like he does too 

i dont know what to do i need some closure or im not going to be able to move on from this i dont know what it is but its driving me crazy im so happy with my current boyfriend and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling hes such a good person i also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but i cant get it out of my head im trying to take a nap right now between classes but i cant sleep because my mind is racing ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever

i want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but i dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face if he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me if my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed on one hand i want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too where would i go from there on the other hand i feel like i cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but i dont want to

please help me because i really have no idea what to do",relationships,if youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that although you say youre happy id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason thats a pretty important element to be missingit may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex if you feel the need to see what is possible there i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first you cant have everythingif you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship the grass isnt greener a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future,1,1,1144

im trying so hard to maintain the friendship because thats what he wants were no longer in the same office which i thought would help me get over these feelings but we still talk about work and hes constantly touching me so im still very drawn to him hes a hugger and such a sweet guy so i find myself fantasizing all the time about what could have been and what could still be but hes clearly not interested hes younger than me and prefers model types but i see him checking me out a lot which gives me hope how do i get him out of my system and still maintain the friendship",workplace relationshipssocial relationships,it sounds like a tricky situation if you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him getting over him may not be possible what makes it even trickier is that his actions hugs and touching may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light if you truly want to force yourself to get over him cutting contact or setting strict boundaries may be necessary if you dont see him over time you can begin to forget about him if you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches you will not feel mislead or have the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested it would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelings to change thus being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him good luck,1,1,1088

a few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her so for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen she had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused she doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly i know she needs time and all i can do is take care of myself we have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again im completely in love with her and im in extreme pain",relationships,love doesnt hurtyour description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this womanin some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care aboutthis sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one  your descriptions are of the womans life parenting and relationship dilemmas not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long termtry distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday lifebeing aware of how much love youd like to give and receive is valuable selfknowledgeyour ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you being the result of the womans choices sounds like the opposite of lovethe relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes  it sounds like this is its main value in your life not that it is sustainable in realitygood luck,1,1,1151

the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life

im of course hurt and in shock i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go my heart will still be torn apart i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought",marriageintimacy,hi jayuya im struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cant do that and i dont think either of those things will help you id like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe do you have supports do your family and friends know whats happening in your life have you ever been to a womens shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly thats what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best,1,1,1185
2080,"im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend at the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date he has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two i have nothing against her except for the fact that she has tims heart he is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but i dont really believe him 

lately tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year hes been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her but hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves he seems really torn up about it and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves 

he knows that i still crush on him he doesnt rub it in my face hes a good guy but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us how do i do that when the time comes how do i support him and show him that im here without wanting to hook up how do i make him feel better he is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which i think is ridiculous",relationships,first off i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelings and understanding regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upim not sure if that is possible if you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues good luck to you,1,1,977

what could be causing this and what can i do about it",intimacyhuman sexualitydepressionrelationships,first step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based not a medical condition which requires care and attentionif you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herselfoften a problem transfers ownership of who shows itif you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt  if she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem she can avoid looking at herselfthere may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problemmedicine looks for symptoms to treatour emotional lives are much more indirectif you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live for example then your frustration may show up in your sex lifebasically do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the sameyou may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away,1,1,1191
