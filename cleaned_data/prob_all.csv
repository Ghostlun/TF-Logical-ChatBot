   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,it is very common for people to have multiple issues that they want to and need to address in counseling  i have had clients ask that same question and through more exploration there is often an underlying fear that they  cant be helped or that they will be too much for their therapist i dont know if any of this rings true for you but most people have more than one problem in their lives and more often than not  people have numerous significant stressors in their lives  lets face it life can be complicated therapists are completely ready and equipped to handle all of the issues small or large that a client presents in session most therapists over the first couple of sessions will help you prioritize the issues you are facing so that you start addressing the issues that are causing you the most distress  you can never have too many issues to address in counseling  all of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling,1,1,960,F,0.6476112738264392,0.35238872617356076

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,this is a common worry clients have about counseling something that can be helpful to remember is that what were seeing as different issues often have a theme or are connected in some way for example the sexual abuse and cancer history you shared have similar traumatic and stressful effects on the mind and body and insomnia can be exacerbated by the longerterm effects of what youve been through similarly anxiety and depression are different ways our pain and distress presents itself but have underlying connections  sometimes theyre even connected to the same trauma response the hope is that youll have a counselor who can help you explore these different areas of wellbeing and facilitate a process of putting the puzzle pieces together while creating space to discover what you need in order to find some liberation and healing from the issues youve named,1,1,863,F,0.5989638241445616,0.4010361758554384

515,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable accurate ones as an example im scared of spiders but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind mindfulnessbased therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally truealthough it may seem counterintuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts goby remaining present in the body youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response,1,1,1200,F,0.5930747169226,0.4069252830774

629,can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor every detail about what happened during the other parents visitation in order to help build a case for child custody,parenting,"i see a few issues herefirst the age of the child is important  if the child is considered an
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age  and age  no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions 
if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law",1,1,1129,T,0.42215654057005003,0.57784345942995

important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about

experience roughly the same number of dreams  the difference often is just
whether we remember the dreams or notan increase in the number or frequency of distressing dreams

counselor could help if the dreams themselves
are not troubling you may just be remembering them more than most people do",1,1,551,F,0.546001450152747,0.453998549847253

   the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life
   im of course hurt and in shock i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go my heart will still be torn apart i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought",intimacy,hi jayuya im struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cant do that and i dont think either of those things will help you id like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe do you have supports do your family and friends know whats happening in your life have you ever been to a womens shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly thats what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best,1,1,1185,F,0.7251193101006228,0.27488068989937725
1159,i just got married with my husband i have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past i know all marriages have problems but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust its hard for me to let go because i love him but i am getting tired,intimacy,hi louisianayou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshiptrust is the first stage in a relationship moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element but you didnt see this coming did you thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface i give you credit for wanting it to work and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust good luck,1,1,779,F,0.6384776724053631,0.3615223275946368

   i want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but i dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face if he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me if my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed on one hand i want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too where would i go from there on the other hand i feel like i cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but i dont want to
   please help me because i really have no idea what to do",relationships,if youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that although you say youre happy id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason thats a pretty important element to be missingit may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex if you feel the need to see what is possible there i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first you cant have everythingif you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship the grass isnt greener a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future,1,1,1144,F,0.6730703650383667,0.3269296349616333

valid   it is very unnerving when thoughts control your life 
one way to combat them is to figure out whose voice the words are said in
oftentimes people say things to us and it stays with us and it is not often
true  we let others opinions penetrate our brains and live rentfree in
our heads  you could try to rewrite the thoughts the negative thoughts
rewrite them in a positive way   for example you are not worth
anything you could rewrite that in a way that shows all the ways you are
worthy  write all your accomplishments and things you have overcome and
proof that you are in fact worthy because you are  you can 
interrupt the thought focus redirect elsewhere if you are replaying a
specific moment you could go back into that moment and retell the moment
rewrite the moment so that it is what you would rather it have been your mind
does not know anything other than what we feed it feed and integrate more
positive thoughts and actions into your routine to possibly see a positive

1876,"ive known my boyfriend for several years we were friends for a long time in  we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state i planned to move in with him in  after i finished school and he found a job however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time we decided later to make it work shortly after i found out that i was pregnant i wanted to tell him during his next visit however he never came to see me and instead asked me for money after i gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts 

soon after i experienced a miscarriage i texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care i was extremely hurt by this i still decided to move back as i had originally planned he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him during this time i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know although he says he did i hardly ever see him he never got a job which was in the original plan  

after that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together once we got back together i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in i thought he had too but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman in fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her when i confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car i dont know what to do",relationshipsdomestic violence,there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life i think youll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect,1,1,739,F,0.6637943862751388,0.3362056137248612
1877,"i have been with my husband for almost  years we got engaged a little after  years of being together i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose 
when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned i was happy but i couldnt help feeling disappointed too
i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldnt help how i was feeling
we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds  i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted
i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding what i wanted will never happen
i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset
i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just cant control it its ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it plus i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed 
why cant i move on",marriage,its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either however like you know the marriage is the most important thing  how many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship i assure you that there are plenty try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired focus on what you can control now perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringi would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately but after that close that chapter and move on it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change,1,1,1097,F,0.795749162213593,0.20425083778640696

2038,that phrase makes me crazy it happens anytime i point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his ipad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that i got all the things he needs to bake a pie another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up over and over again he lets the dog run out and i am afraid he will get hit by a car,marriage,its hard to say what is okay and what is not okay as it depends on what you and your husband feel is appropriate in your relationship if you are feeling like you need to walk on eggshells or that you cant speak your mind and say how you feel then that sounds like a problem i would recommend having an open discussion with your husband about communication between the two of you in general do this during a time when there is little or no conflict and emotions are not heightened let him know how you feel and give him specific ideas of how you would like him to respond instead of saying enough additionally try and see his perspective and understand why he shuts you down perhaps he feels like he is being told what to do constantly or that he gets little positive feedback from you an open dialogue about how to discuss issues going forward will likely help seeing a couples therapist will also greatly assist with teaching better communication skills and seeing if there are underlying issues that need resolution best of luck to you guys,1,1,1042,F,0.7231810211648539,0.27681897883514606

2069,"ive been with my husband for eight years now we have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated i took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes however we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust my insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again during that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child

the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life

2071,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,addictionsubstance abuse,the first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change  frequently our problems keep us in denial  although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone  the best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together  alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction  know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed i really recommend an inpatient stay for at least  days for anyone who is dealing with addiction whether combined with mental health issues or not  if this is not a possibility then the next best thing would be an intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues  know that there is hope for what you are experiencing  you can get control over these issues  the next step is finding the team andor facility that is going to help you do it,1,1,1168,F,0.7027576890988712,0.29724231090112885

he knows that i still crush on him he doesnt rub it in my face hes a good guy but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us how do i do that when the time comes how do i support him and show him that im here without wanting to hook up how do i make him feel better he is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which i think is ridiculous",relationships,first off i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelings and understanding regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upim not sure if that is possible if you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues good luck to you,1,1,977,F,0.6809037269871627,0.3190962730128373

adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age  and age  no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions 
if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law",1,1,1129,T,0.42215654057005003,0.57784345942995

2554,i dont know how to tell someone how i feel about them how can i get better at expressing how i feel,relationships,"lets just start with being real expressing
yourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard it takes courage and work
to be vulnerable my guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable ie expressing yourself is unsafe my assumption would be
you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again this is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt it
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayi would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally after you feel you have a good grasp
on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others choose others that
feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family
