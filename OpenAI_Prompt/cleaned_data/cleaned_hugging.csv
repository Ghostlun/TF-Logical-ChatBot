   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling in fact most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected in counselling we work together collaboratively to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care basically its like a road map of where you want to go how are you going to get there looking at stopovers some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic however necessary of course these plans can also change due to internal what we have control over like our thoughts feelings and behaviours or external reasons those things that are outside our control i would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by cojourneying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia depression and anxiety as well as being a breast cancer survivor then to help you by developing new coping strategies psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be i know you can do it and you will see firsthand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck i like to quote nike where their motto is just do it you can do it

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,i just want to acknowledge you for the courage to take the step to get support it can be overwhelming to have so many things going on and it might be hard to figure out where to start i truly believe that one of the biggest advantages to working with a therapist is that a therapist can help you prioritize and work with those issues that need to be addressed first and foremost a therapist will help you with the flow of dealing with different aspects that come up some issues may even be related to one another for examples some clients with depression may also feel anxiety about their depression also rest assured many clients go to therapy for multiple issues we are complex beings i encourage you to reach out to a therapist and talk about this concern you may find out that even upon the first meeting you will feel hopeful that you will be able to create a plan with a therapist to address your issues i dont believe you have too many issues i think starting sooner rather than later will put you on the path to healing good luck i am rooting for you

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,its not really a question of whether you have too many issues for counseling but more what would you like to work on in counseling you control the direction of sessions and depending on how youre feeling in a particular day can predict what direction that session takes if you want to work on all the issues youve listed it will just take some dedication on your part to see through the counseling long enough to find a resolution to each of the issues that is satisfactory to you you work at your own pace in counseling and it does seem like you may be overwhelmed with the evergrowing list but you may just be in search of self improvement and making yourself better which is a great thing it seems as though you may need some form of resolution to what has happened in the past and to work through the trauma you have experienced that may be the base of your counseling needs in which self esteem and depressionanxiety may fall underneath it as well if you want to start counseling dont let what you need to work on overwhelm you find the counselor that best fits with you and together you both can tackle any issue

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,this is a great question i personally dont believe that any client could ever have too many issues for counseling in fact that type of thinking may be stopping you from seeking counseling so it may be hindering you from getting the help you need in fact all of what you described points to the importance of you seeking help in order to cope with the many challenges in your life if you seek counseling it will be important for you to understand that you may need to remain in counseling for a sustained period of time in order to work through each of these issues all of these issues wont be able to be solved right away or in a brief period of time counseling will take commitment and hard work but it is possible for you to recover and heal from all of the issues you describedmany clients come into counseling with numerous issues rather than just one particular thing most of the time the issues relate to and exacerbate each other we call these comorbid conditions which means that two or more mental health problems exist at one time a lot of the times when you start to work on one issue the other issues get better as a resulti encourage you to find a professional therapist that can help you learn how to cope with all of the mental health difficulties that you described you deserve the help just as much as anyone else

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,starting counseling and bringing in a lot can feel overwhelming like youve brought too many full suitcases and its scary to think about opening them all  my strategy would be to help you take inventory of all the areas youd like to eventually work on and then prioritize what youd like to work on first  we would just focus on what seems manageable to work on for now what suitcase do you want to open and how much do you want to unpack   often times symptoms have similar root issues so once you start to work on one area and it gets better other symptoms can get better too  being a breast cancer survivor you already have a chest of skills and tools that have helped you get through  its likely those skills can be applied in other areas for healing

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,hii think at the start of counseling it is very common to experience our live in this way the weight we carry is such a burden overwhelming and completely out of control or at least it would be if we let it usually we have found a way to deal with these feelings and keep ourselves under tight control even if we can feel ourselves slipping further and further away throughout therapy it is likely you will work through much of this slowly but surely and realize that while the way you have coped was useful to you at one time it isnt useful to you anymore i hope this helps

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,this is a common worry clients have about counseling something that can be helpful to remember is that what were seeing as different issues often have a theme or are connected in some way for example the sexual abuse and cancer history you shared have similar traumatic and stressful effects on the mind and body and insomnia can be exacerbated by the longerterm effects of what youve been through similarly anxiety and depression are different ways our pain and distress presents itself but have underlying connections  sometimes theyre even connected to the same trauma response the hope is that youll have a counselor who can help you explore these different areas of wellbeing and facilitate a process of putting the puzzle pieces together while creating space to discover what you need in order to find some liberation and healing from the issues youve named

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,it feels overwhelming right like if i have this many issues and i cant deal with them how can somebody else yet for a decent therapist your issues are totally doable it will take time therapy is not a magic cure but if you are patient with yourself you can move through each of the issues some of the issues like the sexual abuse and some of the trauma from being a breast cancer survivor can be dealt with a little more quickly using an eye movement therapy like emdr or accelerated resolution therapy some you are going to have to feel the pain and learn coping strategies know that you are not a lost cause and there are people that come in all the time with just as many issues if not more counseling can initially feel scary overwhelming and so completely vulnerable which is exceptionally difficult for sexual abuse survivors just know the hardest part is often taking that first step to get help and knowing that there is somebody willing and happy to support you as you get emotionally healthier

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,since you have not had counseling for any of these issues i would encourage you to do so during your initial visit a therapist will gather data about your presenting problem and symptoms medical history as well as any significant events that have occurred in your life such as abuse parental separation or divorce  and so forth during the sessions a competent therapist will ask you what issue you want to address first part of your treatment plan will not only include your diagnosis but also other areas of your life that need clinical attention and that can be considered additional stressors during the sessions you will most likely explore the sources of your depression and anxiety as well as your trauma history sexual abuse is often challenging to discuss particularly if you have never talked to anyone about ithoweverif the  therapist strives to create an emotionally safe environment no matter how many issues you believe you have you will feel supported to reveal your psychological distress layer by layer

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,absolutely not its actually quite rare for someone to come in to therapy for just one thing more often than not even people who seek out therapy just for anxiety often find a host of other related things when they start peeling back the layers in therapywhen clients come to me with a list of things like this our first step is to put it all out there and then to work on finding the constellation all of these things tie together to form a more complete picture of who you are and how your experiences have impacted you and have led to other experiences for example many clients find it helpful to understand how a history of sexual abuse can increase the likelihood of developing insomnia seeing how everything ties together often helps people to slow down and take a step back from the tendency to take each of these struggles as a personal flaw or failure and to see how the whole picture fits plus on the upside once youve started to piece together the larger picture you can use that to decide where to begin once you begin learning skills you can apply to one area often times those same skills can be applied to other concerns with just a little variation for example the skills required to process through the beliefs you developed as a result of sexual abuse so that you can start shifting your mindset to more helpful perspectives is actually the same skills you can use to change the thought processes that maintain insomnia so the skills can be generalized relatively easilyas long as youre still breathing theres no such thing as too far gone

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,it sounds like you fear that you may burden your counselor or you will be too much for them to handle  that fear is very normal and that doesnt mean it is true  it speaks to the fact that you are very human with a multitude of experiences that maybe dont fit into one neat and tidy category however it may be worth your time to explore if there is a theme that ties your experiences together eg fear of death fear of loss etc  when i first see clients i want to know how they perceive seeing a counselor and the things they fear about the process  it sounds like you may benefit from voicing and processing through these concerns with a counselor you feel is a good fit for you and your needs  its also important to note that you are already a great candidate based on your question you seem to have interest in seeking help enough motivation to ask questions about counseling and courage to put some tough stuff out there despite anonymity  those are all reasons you are already a wonderful fit for counseling

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,the short answer is absolutely not the longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues and it may feel quite muddy in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you its important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person i use the words might be able to expect because therapy experiences can vary but that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over timeit might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required week in and week out it isnt easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced and so consistent practice of selfcare including leaning on support systems outside of therapy is key

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,absolutely not when we have the courage to accept the challenge to address whatever is causing us pain the solutions often generalize to many if not all of our symptoms i would suggest that unresolved trauma from sexual abuse is likely a primary contributing factor however it is important that you first build a trusting relationship with a therapist experienced in trauma treatment as this is an area of specialty that not all therapists are skilled in treating choosing one issue to work on such as anxiety or depressive symptoms and starting there will allow you the opportunity to get to know your therapist learn coping skills for managing distressing symptoms and establish emotional safety before jumping into trauma work

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,i dont think you have too many issues for counseling  if a client came to me for help with the same issues that you have listed here i would first want them to meet with their doctor to get a physical to rule out any biological causes to your depression anxiety and insomnia  i would work with you on deciding which of these issues to tackle first  i usually suggest starting with the issue that is easiest  reading through your symptoms i might choose anxiety to start with since you are in the early stages of it  i like to give my client skills they can use right away so i would focus on teaching you breathing exercises to manage the anxiety as well as cognitive restructuring so that when an anxious thought pops up you can talk yourself through it  once you felt that you had some control over the anxiety id start to work on some of your other concerns but i would seek your input on what you felt like might be good to work on next  my gut is that some of these issues would be resolved as you worked on others  for example as you worked on your anxiety and began to process your trauma and as you began to work on self care and getting more sleep  your self esteem would probably improve  i encourage you to meet with a therapist and ask them how they might be able to help you  these are just some thoughts that came up for me on how i might help someone with the same or similar symptoms

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,i think this is a very common question that people who have never been to counseling before have  there is a lot of anxiety in going to counseling for the first time  this is normal  in answer to your  question the answer is an absolute no  an important thing to remember about getting counseling is that it is a courageous first step towards hope and healing  getting help is like training to run a marathon it is not a sprint  you have shared a lot of issues that you are dealing with from your past that are now negatively impacting your present but i believe that in getting the right kind of help and support none of them are impossible to overcome  part of the therapeutic process is defining and prioritizing therapy goals  in collaboration with you as a client a therapist is there to help you with this process in determining what you would like to work on first  not getting counseling based on the history you have shared has the potential to put you more at risk for mental and physical health issues  you are already seeing this happen as you begin to experience new symptoms namely your anxiety  in therapy you will gain understanding and insight as well as learn skills and strategies to manage the symptoms you are experiencingin conclusion i would encourage you to reach out to a licensed counselor who has experience in treating trauma griefloss and will address shame  these are three areas that i have found that gets to  the core issues that are contributing to your depression and anxiety   i believe you can get the help you need to find hope and healing  best of luck to you

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,not at all my dear human beings are complex creatures and in my opinion our issues interconnect in a very nuanced web between our levels of being for example mind body and spirit everything you bring up affects all three the truly beautiful thing about the human body is that when you begin to work on one the others improve as welli would encourage you to seek out a counselor whos style and approach speaks to you and start with whichever issue feels most pressing to you a skilled therapist will flow with you at your own pace and make recommendations to other professionals eg physicians holistic practitioners emdr specialists for trauma etc as needed to complement the psychotherapy work youre doing with him or her to help you find the total healing you seek i wish you well on your journey

   ive never had counseling about any of this do i have too many issues to address in counseling",depression,everyone has topics to discuss when they start therapy   there is no correct number of topicsyousometimes people go to therapy for one specific area of their life   not everyone has the time or interest to utilize therapy just when a significant topic arises in their lifesince you are one person no matter how many or few topics you would like to address in therapy all the topics relate to youpossibly the result of your therapy will be more transformational than if you talked only on one topic  lucky you to be on the cusp of clearing and resolving many vulnerabilities at once   you will feel brand new by the time you finish your therapy work
86,my apartment manager wont let me keep an emotional support dog,i have been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression by my family doctor they wrote a prescription for me to have an emotional support dog i have the paper work and i gave it to my apartment manager they said i cant keep the esd because im not disabled what do you suggest i do,depression,this can be a difficult situation  typically only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as service animsls even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same wayyou might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you if possible you may want to consider a different apparent that is more animal friendly

   i use to be in therapy as a child alll throughout elementry middle and high school i had counseling  times a week i havent be in counseling lately though",depression,thanks for reaching out with this important questionto start ill say the diagnosis for depression can differ depending on what the context of those markers are  for example depression is diagnosed differently if theres a bipolar element or if someone is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol  it doesnt sound like thats what youre experiencing but those are just two examples of many  how thats diagnosed is a process that a therapist is best equipped to do in person with a thorough assessment  sometimes we find that depression is subclinical meaning it doesnt reach the typical level of disorder that doesnt mean its less important or worthy of care  most of the time diagnosis doesnt make a huge difference in treatment but there are some disorders that need pretty specific modalities and componentsfor example people with bipolar i often need medication to help stabilize symptomsid also say that more importantly you know yourself best  you are clearly trying to make sense of some things you are feeling and maybe how they are connected to some things youve been through  i can also see you are motivated to feel better  no matter what others think your perceptions and experiences are most important  you get to decide whether or not your circumstances are a lot for you  not everyone is built the same and that is certainly impacted by trauma and significant stressors in the developmental years  its also not your fault that things are hard  you didnt ask for nor did you create your life experiencesoverall if you know some of your healing may come from naming what you feel you can absolutely continue to seek out solid information and maybe that will be with a counselor if thats what you desire  kudos to you for asking this question here too you are dedicated to yourself whether you see it that way or not

   how can i get through to him so he will take me seriously",depression,we cannot control how our partners will react when we ask for support it is important to focus on what you can control which is you it is important to know what kind of support you need and lead with that for example i dont need you to try and fix this but i need you to listen while i tell you what i have been feeling when i am done a hug would be nice or i am feeling stuck and whenever i think about this issue i just get so sad can you help find a solution if we can tell our partner what we expect upfront then it is more likely that you will feel supported it is very empowering to know what we want and to ask for it it may be hard to be direct because we want our partner just to know what we need but that is not realistic there are a few thinking errors in this conversation working with me you will learn all about thinking errors and how to replace them

   how can i get through to him so he will take me seriously",depression,it can become painful when we feel unheard and invalidated especially if this becomes a pattern in our communication we begin to build walls and boundary ourselves more rigidly letting very little of our authentic selves out  as many others have said your husband may feel defensive at the fact that you are unhappy and may not know how to process that feeling it may be that your husband isnt clear on what you need when you tell him that you are depressed in these scenarios it often helps to ask yourself what needs do you specifically want met do you need a listening ear to vent to only do you need a literal shoulder to cry on physical comfort and reassurance that it will be okay do you need feedback advice and guidancedo you need to feel that your experience matters to your husband and just hear him say i see and hear you and you matter to me do you need support in finding resources or desire to seek therapy together with your spouse when were clear on our own needs its easier to communicate to our spouse without them failing to meet expectations that we may not have even known we had if you are already seeking therapy for your depression i encourage you to invite your spouse for a session so that your therapist can shed light on areas of your experience that your husband may not understand if you find that this type of communication is a pattern in your marriage seeking couples counseling will help solve that communication puzzle within your marriage and help you understand each other

   how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone",depression,hello and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common in fact most people if not all have felt this to some degree at some point in their life you are not alone changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts  its hard to do our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take its place without your permission another thought can just pop in there the new thought may feel worse than the last one my guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here people often try thinking positive thoughts debating with their thoughts or simply telling themselves that they need to snap out of it  which is also a thought that carries some selfcriticism some people try a different approach and there are counselors out there that can help you with this the idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts you change how you respond to them you learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they dont have the same impact on you that they do right now for some people they actually do begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently acceptance and commitment therapy may be a good choice for you there is information online and even selfhelp books that you can use to teach you the skills that i mentioned because they are skills they require practice but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them as for suicidal thoughts i am very glad to read that this has not happened to you still you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression if you begin to think about this it is important to reach out to a support system right away the national suicide prevention lifeline is  the text line is  i hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpcc

   how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone",depression,hi there  here are some things for you to considerfirst things first  its much more likely that you feel that you are worthless to everyone  not them thinking that  its hard to think or perceive beyond our own mindset  it is doable but with practice and assistance often what we thinkbelieve about ourselves is not what others think or perceive  this is a thinking trap known as mind reading  i have a blog post on my website about this  second although what you are describing sounds consistent with depression know that you  with professional help  can positively effect how you feel and perceive yourself and your surroundings  many others have felt similarly and have gotten betterthird be curious about your situation  ask yourself am i sick and tired of being sick and tired  if so then ask the next question then why have i not gotten around to doing something about it  if not tired of being sick and tired then ask yourself why not and do i really want to feel this way for life  depressed folks generally do not prioritize themselves to seek  and sustain help  hence why you said you never got around to it all the while feeling down and blue and not able to sleep  here is another question to ask yourself if i were oozing blood or pus from a cut and it would not stop  would i seek help  if so why then but not now in this situation  fourth seek a live licensed mental health professional now  i understand you never thought about suicide before but that was before  suicidal thoughts and tendencies can be sudden and automatic  depression is one of the main drivers for suicidal ideations and attempts  this is a nice first step to gain insight  take the next step to seek help  ohh i understand it can be a maze in finding help  some ways to do it are if you have health insurance to their site and use a keyword search for depression read some of the information and see which one connects with you a bit more  no health insurance go to psychology today or this site to see if someone is in city or state if online therapy search by depression also if having a major issue paying for therapy  go to a church counseling center or non profit to see if they have reduced rates they can be staffed with interns but they are all supervised by seasoned clinicians  and that help is much better than what you likely have now  a motto i have  partially from my grandmother  is know better do better live better  you are in process of knowing  continue on

   how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone",depression,the sense of being worthless appears to certainly  be a limiting belief about yourself that you have been cultivating one way to transform a limiting belief to a more adaptive and empowering belief would be to explore if there exists any evidence to support the limiting belief about worthlessness first list all of your personal strengths  or talk with a supportive friend who can give you feedback about the qualities you have that they love about you you may soon discover that there is little evidence to support your limiting belief you can also experiment with asking yourself supposing i believed the opposite of my limiting belief the theorist karen horney used to say that each individual has a unique universal inner power which represents a fountain of the growth process i encourage you to tap into that inner power and develop new empowering ideas about who you truly are

   how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone",depression,you can absolutely change that feeling which is actually a combination of thoughts and feelings  these types of thoughts are classified as core beliefs because they are typically beliefs about who you are eg i am a bad person i am unworthy i am incompetent etc  shame is a cluster of feelings that accompanies these beliefs a combination of selfhatred sadness disgust and guilt  although you cant make them go away completely you can definitely shrink them  these beliefs have actual neural pathways in the brainthe more you travel these pathways the stronger the belief  one way to fight these is by creating strengthening neural pathways that lay more dormant such as beliefs that you are lovable worthy and deserve to be alive  even if you dont believe these thoughts thinking them creates competition with the core beliefs you want to change  the more you travel the new neural pathways the stronger they will get over timei understand this can take time and feel really tough to do  something you can do to deal with your feelings in a more shortterm way is to focus improving your sleep  as you are probably experiencing lack of sleep can contribute to worsened depression  your primary doctor may be able to help with your specific sleep issues but there are some ways you can work on sleep on your own  something you can try is writing down the worries or thoughts you have before you lay down for the night  this can help the brain to feel less inclined to ruminate as your paperjournal holds the thoughts for you it also helps to have a nightly routine that stays the same every night  this tells your brain to start producing chemicals that induce sleep just like going into a restroom can signal the body to urinate  if you find yourself lying awake in bed or waking in the night leave the room and do something calmingrelaxing if you are awake for more than  minutes  it can be tough to change your bodys relationship to sleep so give it timeit can take a few weeks to really notice changesone of the best strategies we have for dealing with depressive symptoms is behavioral activation that could mean socialization exercise or anything that gets you doing an activity you wouldnt normally do  if exercise seems too intimidating or unrealistic you can just view it as movementanything that gets you up and moving  taking walks outside gardening cleaning etc can count as movement  its easy to surrender to the lack of energy but that also keeps the cycle of depression alivemedications can help as well if you feel like you need something beyond what you can do for yourself at the moment  antidepressants are great options for depressive symptoms  research shows that combining psychotherapy with antidepressants can have really effective outcomesim unsure if your sentence about not contemplating to attempting suicide means you dont feel that way now or that things are moving in that direction  if they are make note of your social supports and who you would be willing to reach out to  if you have someone you are comfortable enough to let them know what you are going through it may be worth your effort to have them plan to check in on you  you can also contact the hopeline by texting hope to  or the suicide prevention lifeline at talk

   how can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone",depression,"you have

several things going on here the sleep should be addressed with a primary care

physician to rule out any physical issues sleep is the big reset and allows us

to function in the day what happens during a depression is that our thoughts

race and it is as though our brain wont shut off medication can help with

this i also use a pranayama yoga breathing technique called the four

fold breath which has great usefulness for relaxing us  and often does work quite well with allowing

us to sleep you can read about it here    httpsbillleavitttherapycombreathingtechniquesthefourfoldbreathyour

thoughts on feeling worthless to everyone fall under a heading of thinking

error in cognitive behavioral therapy cbt known as overgeneralization in cbt

thoughts lead to emotions so we are going to pick the statement apart and then

reframe it first list

the evidence that contradicts the thought has anyone in the past made positive

comments toward you this might be hard to recall if we are in a rut but at

some point in life we frequently have had some positives expressed towards us

by others  everyone is an absolute the

specifics on why you are thinking this need to be addressed how are you

arriving at this conclusion there may be specific people that we want more

validation from or specific people might have made offhand hurtful comments such

as a family member teacher or coworker but if i extrapolate that to a global

and think that everyone thinks i am worthless that thought is not rooted in

facts  
what are

the pros and cons of thinking this way what are the benefits and costs there

are very little pros or benefits to thinking this way its just going to

continue to tear you down and make you feel bad so can we reframe the thought

about the situation is there another way of looking at the situation again

we need the specifics on how you are arriving at this conclusion and a one on

one therapist can definitely help you with this but the thinking that you are

using to arrive at the conclusion needs to be recast into a more helpful

mindset"

   are they right am i depressed",depression,"i wouldnt necessarily say you are clinically depressed based on
that first paragraph in your question because that could describe more
introverted behavior people who feel more energy from a more internal approach
as opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others it is more
in the second paragraph that i would be inclined to say that further
exploration is definitely needed the diagnosis of major depressive disorder is
more than just those two symptoms but there are more mild forms of depression
that can be equally damaging to someone if left untreatedhowever one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone who
feels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having a
therapist know them and even less worthy of being helped do you feel that
might be you if so could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture
and all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself and realizing that
thoughts and feelings arent always rational in that you are worth getting the
helpmy recommendation just from the information would be that you seek
out a supportive listening ear in the form of a therapist who can allow you
the space to express some of these difficult experiences and help you name for
yourself what your struggle is to empower you to name it for yourself as
opposed to everyone labeling andor judging you for it might be an extremely
worthwhile start for you"

   are they right am i depressed",depression,although some people managing depression feel sad or down  it is a possible to have depression without an obvious sad mood  many people indicate that they feel numb or flat  people managing depression often have low motivation they may stay in bed for long periods of time and only get up for absolutely necessary activities  people with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame   if you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks i recommend that you see a counselor to get a more indepth evaluation   the symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression and with a bit of support you could regain energy and improved selfesteem  the stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a label of depression seem scary  the important thing to remember is that mental health disorders are as important as and as treatable physical health disorders    hang in there  healing is possible

   are they right am i depressed",depression,hello being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily we look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth if that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd heres a secret that might help with most of those issues not much of those problems ive just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world if you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others like your peers i can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another persons suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen yearswhen we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress whos popular whos not popular and for the most of it all of that is external so the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside the internal stuff with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside the internal that is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold so fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes in your post you mentioned that you live with your dad are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy it is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause it is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better without causing harm to yourselfhave you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so do you have a friend who is your best friendsomeone who is there for you no matter what if not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors they are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful its called teen line httpsteenlineonlineorg it helped me when i was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well you might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area if you want are in washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling you might also check with your school for assistancedont be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel adults dont always have a handle on it either being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty but you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it i wish for you the very best and bright future

   are they right am i depressed",depression,the answer to the question of whether or not youre depressed is less meaningful than what you are doing to feel strong and secure in your lifeotherwise people shortcut themselves to go deeper in understanding who they are and what theyd like to do with their lives and accept depression as though it is their new namewhat you write sounds like classic depressionwhat to do about this feeling is to get closer to yourself in an accepting way  assume that what you do in daily living is somehow necessary  unless you are doing immoral or illegal actions to other people to accept your own wishes as truth will open you to appreciate why you do what you domake believe youre interesting and find out more about who you are if you have trouble to start with thinking of yourself as worth understandingthe more you appreciate who you are and your unique strengths vulnerabilities and fears the more these will dissolve by what seems on their ownin fact they will disappear bc you are believing in yourself and your waysgood luck

   are they right am i depressed",depression,im alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself from the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth all of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future i do hope that you will reach out feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need

290,is selfdiagnosing okay,im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,depression,sounds like you are really concerned about the things you are feeling and the way you are interacting with others  selfdiagnosing is not typically recommended since there could be a misinterpretation of the criteria even if you do seem to fit the mold  how you interpret how you feel or how you behave can be distorted no matter who you are  i actually did this to myself when i was in graduate school and it turned out to be wrongwith that being said i believe people are the experts on their lives and know best what is happening for them  what is telling you that you have these diagnoses  what does it mean about you if you do  i dont give a ton of weight to diagnoses in the sense of treatment because a lot of diagnoses share the same underlying themes and origins  both borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder can be a result of childhood trauma so treating one may not look that different from treating the other oneand the most important factor will always be the relationship you have with your therapist otherwise treatment wont worki do give a lot of weight to diagnoses in terms of emotional relief  it can be really stressful to feel like theres something wrong with you and not be able to give it a category  it can reduce stigma as well to know that whats happening to you is normal for what youve been through and that others are going through it too  and it definitely helps to know that there are ways to help and people that know how to help youeither way kudos to you for noticing something in your life that you want to change  it seems like relationships are important to you and you maybe worry you are pushing people away that are important to you  even if you do have these disorders you can totally learn how to change your life
291,is selfdiagnosing okay,im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,depression,any diagnosis is limited in its usefulnessknowing the name of some typical ways you may feel think and behave doesnt help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristicsboth selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about itconsider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding
292,is selfdiagnosing okay,im currently struggling with diagnosed depression anxiety and misophonia also i am  sure i have borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder i read the dsmiv taken college psychology etc i know it in my heart i have them is selfdiagnosing okay with the right research,depression,hello and thank you for your question selfdiagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional here are a few reasons for this  making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder to come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned a counselor would consult the dsm but they may also use some type of screening tool assessment or scale many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms  our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves we really cant be objective something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity in addition once you know your diagnosis treating it usually requires help from a professional  sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes selfdiagnoses impossible in and of itself for example someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it that would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves there a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders there are other reasons but these are three important ones now does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis maybe not you may be correct but it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician if a disorder is then found you can begin to talk about treatment hope this was helpful be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
293,how do i tell my parents that i think i have some mental problems,i am pretty sure i have depression and anxiety i also have voices in my head i have problems sleeping too ive already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder i have selfharmed in the last and used to be suicidal how do i tell them this and ask for therapy,depression,talking with parents can be very challenging even if they are loving and understanding  have you ever discussed these issues in the past  if so how did they respond  itd make sense if you were avoiding a discussion if they have responded negatively to you or even neutrally  we rely on our parents for action when we are in need and it can feel so disappointing when they dont meet our needs  if this is the case for you you could still reach out to them if you feel safe to  that might mean being very candid about what you need from them or what you are seeking for yourself  sounds like you already know you are struggling and you want to get some help which is awesomedo you worry they wont believe you or that theyll be disappointed in you for selfharming  if you are struggling with these worries it may be worth talking to another trusted adult about how to bring the issues up to your parents  maybe that adult could be part of the conversation if appropriate or available  also do you have any siblings that are old enough to be part of the conversation  or maybe be a shoulder to lean on  no matter what happens social support is really important so you dont have to go through it all aloneis it possible that your parents or even one of your parents will be proud of you for speaking up for yourself and trying to get help  sometimes depression and anxiety immobilizes us because we fear the worst when in reality there are many more possibilities  one of the things i have my teen clients work on if they want to communicate something to a caregiver is have them come up with a bulletpoint list of the things they need them to know  so maybe your list would include symptoms youve been struggling with how you want to change and what you need from them to help you change  if you do this and it doesnt turn out well remember that its on them and not you  sometimes parents are doing the best they can and sometimes its not good enough  that never means you arent worth helping it could be helpful to make a backup plan for how you will try to reach out to someone if they dont respond wellyou also dont specify your age or if you are even a teen  im assuming you are but if not you may be able to get help without their consent or help  if you are closer to age  you may not have long to wait  i truly hope you find what you need

    i have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative or to distract him into a different light how do i help him",depression,thats a giant task to have to do all on your own  its hard to watch someone you care about feel depressed and im guessing it brings you down too  change is tricky  most people need to hit a rock bottom before they can transform their lives  rock bottom is a moving target thoughmeaning one persons rock bottom could look completely different than someone elses  for some people thats a trip to the hospital for others its failing an exam  its about what brings up enough discomfort with awareness of why with the current way of living that not changing would be more painfuldepression is so hard but it can also be weirdly comforting  it sucks to feel sad but at least you know what to expect  he knows that hes going to get high zone out into his phone and his anger is probably pretty predictable  on the other hand change is uncertain  is he open to seeing a therapist  or open to trying anything new with you  if not thats not your fault nor is it your responsibility  you obviously care but that doesnt mean its on you if he doesnt follow through  it seems like maybe he feels some comfort in the daily structure that you described but even getting out for a walk could help his mindset a bit  overall its not a guarantee that you can help him though it is really incredible that you have so much empathy for him  make sure you are taking care of yourself because you matter too

299,is it normal not to feel empathy,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,depression,thank you for posting  im interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to schoolemployedunemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself  often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion  there are typically points in the day even if it is for only in  minute intervals when we do not feel that negative emotion  when we overgeneralize we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you  ask yourself some of these questions am i being realistic when im overgeneralizing things have i ever noticed a short period of time that i wasnt feeling anxious  what do i notice when i am feeling anxious what am i thinking about  when was the last time i felt empathy  what was different when i was able to feel empathy  hopefully this helps get you started
300,is it normal not to feel empathy,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,depression,its not normal to feel no empathymaybe you do have a little more empathy for yourself than you realize since you seem to express some empathy toward yourself not feeling emotionstry to understand the circumstance about which you feel anxiety   this may increase your empathy toward yourselfif you feel anxiety about a relationship then empathize with having lost the relationshipif you feel anxiety about not having enough funds to pay bills then empathize with yourself for this situationif you feel anxiety about how someone engages with you then empathize with feeling unsure of how to respond to thisbasically see if you can substitute empathy toward yourself for the tension of your anxiety
301,is it normal not to feel empathy,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,depression,its very common to lose the ability to experience empathy when you are overwhelmed burned out andor exhausted  empathy is about accessing your own emotions in a way to understand someone elses experience or circumstance  if theres something in you emotionally that you may be trying to avoid it may shutdown your willingness to feel or express empathy altogether  this also happens often with emotional exhaustion as well as if we arent putting up boundaries with our empathy  brene brown has a great video on this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuvcguzqiione way to think about this is to ask yourself what your anxiety is trying to tell you  is there maybe something that you arent addressing in your life that is bugging you  or do you feel you are addressing too much and are spread too thin  im also unsure if your comment means you dont have any emotion for yourself or you dont have anxiety for yourself but i want to point out that you do have some sort of emotion for yourself  thats the very reason you have asked this question  fear does a stellar job at masking emotions like sadness and shame  you may not be aware of these feelings but they could still existloss of empathy can sometimes lead to a disconnection from the pain of others though the extreme versions of this are not very common  if you do start to experience homicidal ideation or thoughts about seriously harming others its important you talk to someone right away
302,is it normal not to feel empathy,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,depression,empathy usually falls on a spectrum meaning that some people show more than others empathy is the ability to look at the world through someone elses eyes or walk a mile in their shoes there could be some people in your life for whom empathy is easier to feel and those for whom you have no idea what they are experiencingempathy is not usually categorized as an emotion but as something related to emotions for example you could have empathy about someones anxietyim not sure whether you are also referring to the idea that you dont have sympathy for yourself or others thats a different concept but also involves different degreeswhen you say you dont have emotion except anxiety i wonder if you are saying that you have anxiety all the time and it may be covering up other emotions if you are experiencing a lot of anxiety try to look at what it connects to and find something that changes your focus for a few minutes this could be any number of activities such as watching tv cooking reading a book or many other optionsif you are feeling as if you are just going through the motions and not having a lot of emotions about anything if its just been a few days it may just be related to a current stress that will lessen in a few days if it has been quite a while consider tracking your mood and looking at when you do notice changes in your emotions there may be some variations that you are not aware ofif you continue to feel anxious and as if you dont have as many emotions as you would like consider talking with your primary care physician or a local therapist
303,is it normal not to feel empathy,i cant seem to feel any emotion except anxiety not even for myself,depression,"empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life 
it is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature
if you are feeling anxious maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety  but i wonder
if instead of feeling empathy you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety  a good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react sera normal que no sienta empatíaparece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad ni si quiera por mí misma empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que
ellos experimentan la vida  es una
destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas  si te estás sintiendo
ansioso tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad  pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad  una buena manera es estar consciente
que activa la ansiedad y ya que lo identifiques explora que otras reacciones
pudieras tener"

307,how do i find out the cause of my depression and anxiety,i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,depression,the first thing i usually recommend to clients that are coming in for these issues in addition to stress management is visiting their doctor  we really dont know if its something psychological thats influencing your symptoms or if theres other issues happening within the body  pancreas or thyroid issues can perpetuate anxiety and depression symptoms pretty intenselythese are things your doctor knows more about and can help test for and maybe rule outas you probably already know lack of sleep is a giant contributor to an increase in symptoms  we dont know too much about sleep in the research but we do know its necessary to function and function well  some suggestions here from the research we do have creating a calming routine at night can help with your bodys relationship to sleep  this can be your normal nightly hygiene paired with some relaxing videos or soundscapes there are apps for thiscalm headspace panicshield  practicing these for a few weeks can help your brain pair your routine with sleeping  another suggestion directly from the research is not to take naps  yes your brain needs sleep but napping messes with our circadian rhythm and our qualityquantity of nightly sleep  when we sleep we go through sleep stagesbut when we nap those stages arent completed like they would be during a full night of sleep where we go through those stages multiple times  both deep sleep and rem sleep typically when we dream seems to be especially important for feeling rested  napping usually only offers us a small dose of that whereas a full night can offer as many more completed cycles including both these stages  if you are waking into a panic attack this site may give you some info on what that means httpswwwmayoclinicorgdiseasesconditionspanicattacksexpertanswerspanicattacksfaq  heres a great information website that has tons of resources including support groups httpswashingtoncenterforcognitivetherapycomproblemstreatedpanicdisorderpanicdisorderorganizationsglad you reached out here
308,how do i find out the cause of my depression and anxiety,i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,depression,answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneselffirst step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep  as often as possible sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for restaccept too about feeling down  it is normal to feel down once in a while  from this place of selfacceptance trust any answers which come up to your mind  often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces not all at once as a whole unitalso your description about panic attacks is also completely normal   they often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment  they are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at timesso selfacceptance tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter and sleep at odd times if possible are all ways to stabilize yourself which will also feel calm and good
309,how do i find out the cause of my depression and anxiety,i have been feeling more and more down for over a month i have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks but they are almost never triggered by something that i know of,depression,it could be really helpful to see a counselortherapist about your increasing depressionpanic symptoms finding out the cause of depressionanxiety isnt always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason for example if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically ill start to see a lot more that i get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself same with anxiety obviously this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained but thats where working with a counselortherapist comes in i would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic and if you can through the panic attack continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations youre feeling  such as saying to yourself okay im breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight reminding yourself that its just your bodys reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now youre okay and eventually it will go away i highly recommend the sam for anxiety management app for the anxiety piece and i wouldnt be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too
310,what can i do about my depression and anxiety after trying so many things,i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,depression,is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked   if this is possible interview a therapist before  starting therapy   then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your lifealso therapy isnt for everyoneread about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling betterwhat matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods what you believe will be effective
311,what can i do about my depression and anxiety after trying so many things,i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,depression,im sorry youve had a difficult time finding what you need  sounds like you have been trying super hardits common for people to go through a few therapists before they find a fit  i agree with the prior post that relationship is the most important factor in counseling otherwise techniques dont really work  it can be the case that you are connecting with your counselor but not able to implement what you are learning for whatever reason  thats pretty typical in depression when lethargy is high and motivation is low  have you discussed your medication with your prescribing provider  it seems like you have advocated for yourself in the past and have put some effort into trying new things  thats actually really tough to do depression or not  when i have clients that seem to make no progress despite many sessions and different medications i recommend trying a service called genesight  heres the link httpsgenesightcomthis service allows you find medications that fit best with your genetic makeup  i dont have any affiliation to this service but ive seen some success for people that have followed through since it is very personalized  i believe some insurance companies cover the full cost and its easy to uselet me also point out that your motivation is spectacular  you have been through multiple therapists and meds yet you still reach out on this forum filled with counselors  that shows some dedication to yourself and hope that you can find help to change  thats not easy with depression or anxiety
312,what can i do about my depression and anxiety after trying so many things,i have terrible anxiety and depression ive tried various therapists and pills but nothings helped,depression,im sorry that you have tried several different things and not had much reliefi will say that there are several different types of medications that may help and each therapist is different so it is quite possible that a different combination of things youve already tried may be helpfuli would encourage you to continue trying different therapists i would say to give each one at least six sessions before you decide that the approach that they are using is not working for you also most places have a certain sort of structured initial session that must be done but after that the decisions are largely up to what you and the clinician feel is helping if something is or is not working communicate this with your therapist this is a big deal most therapists i know actually welcome this feedbackthere is a fair amount of research into the idea that the therapeutic alliance the relationship that you have in the context of working through the reasons that brought you into therapy is very important also sometimes anxiety and depression can make it difficult to go to therapy on a regular basis if that is something with which you are struggling i would encourage you to talk about that as wellin addition to a solid relationship with a therapist who you connect with you may consider trying something like yoga or meditation mindfulness is sometimes helpful as wellheres a link to questions for finding suitable therapists httpwwwpharmatherapistcomtipsforfindingasuitabletherapist

333,why does it feel as if selfharm is an addiction,i selfharm and i stop for awhile then when i see something sad or depressing i automatically want to selfharm,depression,in a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction  according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this  when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better  if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior  another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences  consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior   someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy andor interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you

337,how can i find myself again,i just dont know what i want in life anymore im cant figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused i cant put things into perspective at all im just stuck and im disappointed with my lack of accomplishments,depression,if you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself  if this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot  maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own  you might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you dont create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you  if you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family its easy to recreate this in adult relationshipsin both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self  basically you spend so much time helping other people that you dont make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment  before you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who you are  supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them  in conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life  it sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now  take one small step at at a time  identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching  meanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing food

she must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person the approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to preverbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain nonordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human developmentdepression is generally experienced as the system shutting down anxiety is a signal that something is wrong anxiety is not the problem it is a sign that there is a problem the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and reinitiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage"

353,i completely lost myselfhow can i find myself again,ive become so jaded that i cant control my thoughts i cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks,depression,i imagine that its pretty disconcerting to feel as though you lost yourselfwhen you said that you are jaded im not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone something life in general or some combination thereofone of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they dont go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some wayas far as finding yourself you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered you could also focus on something that makes you feel happy andor comfortableyou may also consider the list of values here to give yourself an idea of what is most important to you what it is that you are living by now and what values you would prefer to live by httpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarificationif this proves to be difficult consider seeing a local therapist

363,how do i make myself happy without someone who made me happy,how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy now that theyre gone i feel sad its been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent,depression,hello so someone made you happy but is no longer around i am sure that feels devastating as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life happiness is formed within ourselves all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary even relationships fo not last forever if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemwhat i would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself what do you like about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi wish you happiness for every day of your lifebest wishes
364,how do i make myself happy without someone who made me happy,how do i make myself happy without the people who made me happy now that theyre gone i feel sad its been two months now but i seem to be unable to stay okay and independent,depression,it sounds like you have been feeling pretty down since the loss of a relationship and youre wondering how to be happy by yourself intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves even when we are alone can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship working with a therapist you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so
365,is this depression,i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,depression,it is hard to make a definite diagnosis however i would say  that it could be and or a combination of depression stress ptsd etc  more background information would have to be needed  one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms  if what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out  that would not be good when they do  get help before they do
366,is this depression,i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,depression,as far as the formal diagnosis of depression goes it would be hard to determine without more information it sounds like you are noticing that there is a significant difference between how you are feeling on the inside and how you express yourself outwardly part of you is quite distressed and yet it remains invisible to the outside world almost as if it is trapped inside of your body many people who are depressed experience such things as intrusive thoughts emotional numbness difficulty expressing themselves and bodily tension caged animal in working with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what you are going through the nature of the disconnect between you inner feelings and outer expression and eventually gain relief from the distress as well as a greater sense of connection with yourself and personal freedom
367,is this depression,i feel like i am internally screaming all the time externally i am calm but i have this intense unidentifiable emotion constantly i dont feel sad i dont cry a lot i feel rather emotionally distant other than the internal screaming it kind of feels like im a caged animal,depression,it sounds like you are trying to find a label to help you to understand why you are feeling the way you are feeling  sometimes there are no labels for how we feel  sometimes there is no name for the emotions that we are experiencing regardless you do not have to continue to feel this way no matter what you call it  if you are seeking to experience an internal calmness such as your external calmness you may want to try some mindfulness practices or meditation  however being able to get at the root cause of what you are feeling may be what you need to help you release this feeling for the long term  i recommend seeking support for this to allow this internal screaming to get some air and begin to breathe

372,i need help coping with depression as a result of stress,my depression has been reoccurring for a long time it all started when i was being bullied in high school in ninth grade my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates after that i was fine for a couple of years i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work i believe my depression rebooted from there with the stress i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her obviously that wasnt the right choice i regret ever doing that seeing as even though im not selfharming anymore i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed i have a big problem with handling problems in life whenever a problem arises i get stressed and i feel hopeless as if its not going to get better i get way too stressed from my problems which leads to overreacting a lot especially when talking to others which then leads to depression i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldnt be sad all the time and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones,depression,i couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own  unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage  often when i am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress  when we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly for example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress for example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity  is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementstry to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you
373,i feel like my existence is meaningless,ive been depressed for quite a while ive been trying to work through it and my boyfriend has been my rock he is honestly the only person i trust enough to talk to about anything but he decided to break up with me because of my depression i cannot afford to see a therapist or anything so he saw no hope in staying with me my insurance has a  deductible so im screwed ive had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job i have no one my family doesnt care about me they kicked me out when i turned  a few years ago i had friends but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me my exboyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time i see or hear him i break down into tears i found out that i will never be promoted now because of my depression,depression,it sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress social anxieties etc for our depression but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit depression is allencompassing and based on what youve written the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways  the best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive i would recommend contacting your employee assistance program eap if offered by your employer if not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization if however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist as long as your therapist is trained in cognitive behavioural therapy or cbt such as mind over mood
374,why do i feel worthless and tired,i always feel like im doing something wrong everything i do is crappy i want to cry all the time i cant eat or sleep,depression,you are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression low self esteem difficulty sleeping changes in appetite sad mood feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness a full assessmentevaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a major depressive disorder ie are delressed one thing i often tell patients is that do you think you are depressed people often answer yes or no but many individuals respond with a question how would i know to that i often explain that if i stopped watching movies or better stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that i am delressed it would be a sign that i have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that i typically enjoy most  ill ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy  it could be anything from reading to being with friends to skiing to watching tv  i would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or cant find the motivation to engage in it this is another symptom of depression loss in pleasurable activities the good news is that there are many effective available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply you want to modifydecrease your depressive symptoms ie you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless treatment includes one or more of the following psychotherapy medication exercise any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood the even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time  i hope you find this information helpful the most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life
375,how can you get back to my old self,i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancée,depression,sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too  i would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger  i would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard  its hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them
376,how can you get back to my old self,i no longer carry expressions on my face and my emotions are decreasing the more i have fights with my fiancée,depression,sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreementyou could try having a conversation when youre not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancée is open to thatsomething else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree ahead of time that youll say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time usually about an hour and then try to resume the discussion the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts though

379,my husband wants a divorce after i was diagnosed with severe depression,he said he would try and he never did its been nine months and this is making me worse today he said i have to respect whatever decision he makes is that true am i supposed to respect the decision to leave because he cant handle what im going through and leaves me here crying and worried every night hes constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out,depression,wow that is tough there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page i would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already while depression can put real strains on a relationship relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy with that being said  if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end then i cant see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned this doesnt mean that you have to feel okay with the decision  as im sure you wouldnt  but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make if he is wanting to leave  this could make things a lot tougher for you i would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family you do not need to face depression alone  nor should you have to we all need support at tough times like these

385,im a mess physically mentally emotionally and spiritually,im in my late s i never loved or have been loved i need deeper help than is offered in my small town but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia i find myself losing hope more and more my brain barely works anymore and my memory so small i forget in a moment i serve no purpose im incapable of work or anything of value and i never have been im a complete waste of time and resources and yet i keep trying why why does god insist that i continue to exist im not suicidal just tired,depression,the fact that youre reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different and that drive might be something worth tapping into why do i keep trying is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you going a lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy as long as youre in the same state as a therapist offering this service you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home even being in your small town id recommend looking into this option because youre asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers
386,im a mess physically mentally emotionally and spiritually,im in my late s i never loved or have been loved i need deeper help than is offered in my small town but i cannot leave this town because of agoraphobia i find myself losing hope more and more my brain barely works anymore and my memory so small i forget in a moment i serve no purpose im incapable of work or anything of value and i never have been im a complete waste of time and resources and yet i keep trying why why does god insist that i continue to exist im not suicidal just tired,depression,hi oak harbormy heart goes out to you sometimes when im working with a client who experiences depression or anxiety i ask them for a glimpse into their worst moments in their minds what are the worst thoughts that run through your head often they struggle perhaps out of shame maybe they dont want me to know their worst thoughts but i can help them better if i do know because then we have a place to work from you are feeling hopeless and worthless and your thoughts support these intense emotions i dont know you but i strongly believe that you have someone in your life who if they heard your thoughts would say thats not true i know where her value is i believe that there are people who would see your value clearly even if in small things can you imagine those voicesyou mentioned god so lets invite god into the conversation what might god say to you what evidence might godwho sees allhave of your worth what hint might god give you about your purpose you suffer from severe anxiety and the agoraphobia works together with fear theyre a tag team fear tells you perhaps that people will reject you or something equally bad and then agoraphobia steps in and traps you and uses as evidence the fact that no one seems to be reaching out to you to convince you that you have no worth do you see their plan make her scared keep her here aloneconvince her its hopeless they both try to convince you that they are your only friends except theyre lying to you they only want power over youyou forget your worth you forget that we all have worth no one is a waste i believe all gods creatures have worth and that were here to use our gifts to improve the world and to remind each other of our value there are people out there needing your support as much as you need theirs can you find them my guess is youve been alone and isolated for a very long time and its impossible for you to see your worth in this situation we need mirrors to see our worth and other people are our mirrors we see our value in their eyes do you remember the first time you questioned your worth what was happening that you blamed yourself for can you speak to that child and tell her or him that whatevers happening isnt her fault its that child who cannot see her own worth probably because someone treated her as though she had none thats only a story though not the truth can you find another thread of a story who might tell a story of your worthoak harbor i believe that there is help closer than you think fear wants you to believe its hopeless you reached out herecan you reach out again start with just one person and that will lead you to somewhere we dont know where that somewhere is but could it be better than sitting alone youve stopped living you can choose any moment to start i wish you peace and hope 
387,my husband makes me uncomfortable about sex,both of my parents committed suicide together and i was the one who found them i suffer from overwhelming depression which is having an extreme effect on me and my husbands sex lives he does not understand at all and is always making me feel so uncomfortable about sex,depression,hello and thank you for your question first i want to tell you how sorry i am for the experience you had with your parents that is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives it may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there so for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress trauma or grief if your husband will agree to it couples counseling may be your best bet a counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy if he doesnt agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own you still have a lot you are dealing with yourself and sometimes our personally therapy can influence others so it may be a good idea it is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it i hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
388,how can i stop thinking so negatively about myself,im depressed and recently went through a break up its like every guy i like only wants me for sex i think im ugly and sometimes i just want to die i have a son and i got really big when i was pregnant i have stretch marks on my stomach,depression,if you are currently feeling as if you want to die please call  and talk to someoneone way to work on not always thinking so negatively about yourself is to surround yourself with people who are more positive toward you do you have friends or family who are supportivecan you find one part of you that you do not think is uglyif your stretch marks are still bothering you talk with a pharmacist or your primary care physician sometimes there are creams or lotions you can use to decrease stretch marks and they should be able to guide you in the right directionyou mentioned mostly physical things here i wonder if you can find one small thing each day that is going right and build from there perhaps your son makes you smile
389,how do i stop feeling so awful,im not the same anymore i dont know how to get back to who i am im sad and confused and angry and tired i dont sleep well,depression,being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad confused or angry among other emotions if youre having difficulty sleeping try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed if you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed hopefully youll be able to establish a patternsometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changesif youre still struggling consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician there are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you
390,how can i be happy as a stayathome mom,over the years i have slowly lost everything my jobs my cars my freedom and my money i am a stayathome mom who doesnt make any money doesnt have a car never goes out and cleans all day long everyday,depression,there are an infinite number of possibilities here you included a lot of things that you dont have is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together i dont know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the futurei wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you i dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted if you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happenalso again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room for example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe  minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do
391,how do i balance school and life,i dont have time to live or take care of myself at times its causing depression stress and anxiety i dont know what to do,depression,im not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start
392,how do i move past my depression from being separated from the military,two years ago i was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues it has emotionally destroyed me i now basically hate myself its embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone my family has been in the armed forces and it has always been my dream i cant do this alone anymore and now my family is even worried,depression,it sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you it takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of supportis there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life i dont know what else your life involves whether you have close friends or a romantic partner a career activities that you like to do and many other things you may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different directionyour military service will always be a part of you thank you for your service
393,how do i overcome my depression,i feel depressed even though i act like a happy with my family i act like im happy so my son doesnt see me sad i act like my life is a happy life but i feel sad and depressed i sometimes think of killing myself and that my family deserve someone better than me i just cry and write in my book all these feelings,depression,it sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time i would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist if you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment please call  and talk to someonewhile i follow that you would like your son to be unaware of what you are going through that doesnt mean that you cant discuss your feelings with someone else who is it that you trust or could speak with about this a therapist could be one person but perhaps there is someone else in your life as wellone thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy this could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it if you think about this time while holding onto the bead the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy you could do the same thing for a time when you felt comfortable and safehave you recognized any patterns for what is leading you to be sadcan you think of anything that makes you feel good even if it only works for a few minutes
394,what should i do when my parents wont let me see a therapist,i think i may suffer from depression and it is affecting my life and sleep i am on my parents insurance and they wont let me see a therapist because they dont believe in it,depression,the answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live in pennsylvania anyone over the age of  can provide consent for their own treatment as for billing purposes try talking to some local agencies if you are under  you may be able to have medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment if you are over  there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation youre in maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agenciesif you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school this would not require using your insurance

428,i have voices in my head,they dont go away and i feel like im going crazy does that ever stop can it be a symptom of medication,depression,since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you areif you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking and the voices started shortly after then yes it is possible medication created your problemstart by telling whoever gave you the presecription about the problem youre havingcrazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or notcertainly a very positive sign that youre not crazy is that youre selfaware of a problem within yourself and youre responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problemcrazy people usually dont do responsible behaviors

430,im depressed and unable to connect with people after my breakup,a girl and i were madly in love we dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together she moved away for school and we attempted a long distance relationship we eventually broke up its been a year now and i still havent lost my feelings for her i still love her the same way i did ive suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else its damaging me and my life,depression,hi boise im sorry that youve lost this love the fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time its different nowyoure not together anymore but you cant accept this right good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life youve been grieving for longer than you were together oh but really youve not been grievingyoure stuck still loving her instead of moving forward unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache lets look at some possible blocks to moving forwardit could be that theres something unfinished for you maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way if this is the case you have two choices right you can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go if you reach out theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send itit might be worth the risk use the next paragraph to help you decide do you know how she feels how did it end did she end it was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didnt work sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs if shes asked for distance you would do well to honour thata key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck write it down what bad thing can happen if you let it go or if i move forward that will mean  keep goingwhat would be the worst part of that  this kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placeit is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future as in if this person doesnt love me then im unlovable or no one will ever love me as much as she did so your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future can you find another way to reject that message try saying these things to yourselfi know she loved me there is evidence of thati was a good partner there is evidence of thatits part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardi can do this and learn from itmany people like methats how i know im lovableits normal to feel sad im grieving a lost lovei want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrori know more love awaits me if i can get fear out of the wayif this person loved me others can too but not if im clinging to some old memorythese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you i wish you well

435,how do i learn to feel emotion,i dont know how to have emotions i never had any from my birth being human i think of myself as a monster i enjoy pain i cut myself for my climax during sex i think most of the time i lie even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth i was in rehabilitation for four year i have made love with both men and women but it made no impact in my emotions the books that i enjoy reading hp lovecraft and edgar allen poe i go hunting every saturday i feel powerful i dont enjoy the killing of the creature but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature,depression,im not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions from what you write the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel  little kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth  this is information someone told you or was part of your family systempossibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yourssimilarly your comparison of being human means being monster like is not an obvious connection  besides monsters are an idea they arent real  they embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species  again i wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you area way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belongif on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotionsif someone buys you a birthday present be aware of how you feel  keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions
436,how can i help my daughter with her severe depression and her obsessive form of thinking,i am on my own with my daughter i am so worried and stressed about her,depression,your instinct to help your daughter is naturalhow you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing heralso her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describeif you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit herif your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselorstarting therapy without willingness to do so is risky  the person may feel resentful enough to not participate   and sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapyfamily counseling regardless of your daughters age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situationsalso if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response

438,should i go back on my medicine,i have experienced cycles of depression for the past four years and it hits me harder every time it comes back this past time it was extremely debilitating so i went on wellbutrin i could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week a month and a half later i decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair i became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what i needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment i stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away however i still dont feel my sense of self has been completely regained and i have days where i feel a zombielike haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should i go back on the medicine,depression,deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications while there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well while i cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication i would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication if you can find a doctor psychiatrist or arnp who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with themone thing that i am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group while there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference
439,how can i be happy again,at school it feels like ive lost all my friends and ive been really weird with my sleeping patterns i used to cut myself and i really want to again but i change in the locker rooms because i dont want anybody to see i get ticked off easy and overreact at night im very depressed and listen to sad music and all that sort of stuff please help me i just want to be happy again and i feel like im starting to fake a smile at school,depression,as silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of restful sleep is very important when we are feeling low  the reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking  i know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events  in regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced  as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you  one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and i would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future
440,i always feel depressed,i think about death all the time because i feel so alone i want someone to love and someone to love me,depression,feeling alone andor isolated is almost always associated with being depressed as humans we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied given that you are frequently thinking about death i highly recommend that you see a mental health professional as soon as possible to help assess your immediate needs and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression the good news is that with proper consistent treatment and commitment to change things can really turn around for you a therapist can work with you on building enjoyable activities into your daily routine change maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to your sadness and help with exploring what has gotten you to where you are by learning about where your sadness originates engaging in preferred activities and changing your thought patterns you should begin feeling relief from the burden of depression what will likely result is further opportunity to find social outlets and an increased ability to connect with others dont give up create some short terms goals that you can likely achieve and make your treatment a priority and a focus you have already taken the first step in getting better by writing to this site keep on this path and believe in yourself best of luck to you

442,does my fiancée need a service dog,"my fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression she has had it most of her life her anxiety in public places is the worst it gets to points where she cant breathe or move sometimes she wont even go to the restroom so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself she curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks she wont eat or drink in public if she isnt having a panic attack or crying shes clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and selfharming she get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that i cant even get her to eat drink leave the bed or go outside she always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds yelling conflict and even talking to strangers in public she will refuse to go to a store unless i am with her to talk to the cashier for her she is so scared that i cant even get her to drive she doesnt want to get her license because shes scared of trying to drive
   some people have recommended medication but i believe its just going to cover up her illness and not solve it i dont want my fiancée pumped with drugs i believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her when we first met my poodle it would calm her down a lot she took the dog out every time we went out and she seemed much calmer and happier she slowly would eat and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better i am worried and want to help her without medication",depression,it sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee there is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you while it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important i suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts you would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship i wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later

473,is it normal to cry during therapy,i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,anxiety,crying is a natural process when you talk about upsetting things especially in therapy when you are opening up and being so vulnerable i suggest that you consider how you would feelrespond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry if you felt concerned supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions i suggest that you think of times where you have cried and how you felt at that time in public and what would have helped to make you feel less uncomfortable during your tears i think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing laughing coughing you cant help but do those things and most people wont really judge negatively if you do it in public similarly crying is our bodys reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy from a hilarious joke or from being upset if you are very uncomfortable about crying but willing to start therapy perhaps you can ask the therapist if you can turn your chair around if you begin crying this way you are not facing them and can self soothe without worrying about how you physically look at that timei wish you luck and you should be proud of yourself for starting therapy and i wish you a wonderful journey on this important path that you are embarking on

476,is it normal to cry during therapy,i start counselingtherapy in a few days im freaking out but my main fear is that ill cry and embarrass myself is it something to worry about,anxiety,hi there   as someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for  years  i would say that crying is nothing to worry about at all  almost every single person i have worked with has cried at one point or another  starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe   you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before  i have seen  people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard   i myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving   i can assure you that most  if not all  therapists expect clients to cry  and there is nothing to be embarrassed about   crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down   crying is  often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal so  to summarize  dont worry at all about crying it will probably feel uncomfortable  at first  but i promise you  you will not be judged for crying in therapy   and it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and wont judge you good luck

487,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,oh that is too bad not sure is it because of the one you are in therapy with or the counselor   what feelings are coming up and thoughts in your mind first to start  try and put them down and look at what is on paper  if you need to maybe do a group first then individual then couple
488,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,hi there thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist
489,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,hello there  you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal   i realize there a few ways to look at this  i presume you werent anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite  well my initial response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way  have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change  looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen   or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about  this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings  maybe you lack confidence in that therapist   have you let your therapist know how you feel  that would be good to explorei would like to encourage you to look at these ideas  hope it helps   let me knowkindlykeithkeithcounselingcom

491,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,well its generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through much less to someone who you dont know well can be anxietyproducing its also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for youthe most important thing i can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change there are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive so its a good thing to discuss personally i can tell you that i would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel  of the time that opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences andor whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxietythanks for writing here if it caused anxiety for you to do so i hope that feeling is diminishing for you at least related to writing here
492,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,what you are experiencing is extremely normal opening up to someone you dont know from a can of paint can elicit some uncomfortable feelings and make you feel shaky with time and building trust with your therapist you will eventually start feeling less apprehensive before sessions consider bringing this up to your therapist as you both can process this experience together and figure out ways of coping with this anxiety before you come into the therapy room
493,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,hello first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional your continued  dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that  that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips breathe in for approximately  seconds then let it out slowly be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment when you begin i suggest putting your hand on your stomach over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths i know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful we often forget to breathe especially when we  are feeling anxious you are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day i hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases wishing you the very bestlaura cassity lmsw lmac
494,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,it can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial since youre already going to counseling congratulations on taking that big first stressinducing step hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist it can be helpful to address this big elephant in the room and talk to your therapist about this i do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling but regardless of how hard we try sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to the good news is the more you keep at it the more normal it will become
495,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,if you have only been to a couple of sessions it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first therapy is hard work you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before opening up to stranger can be scary after you feel comfortable with your counselor and trust has built up and you feel understood in session you should feel more relaxed i would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work if you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from for example are you and the therapist not a good fit but again if you are just starting out in working together feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling
496,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience
497,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,its absolutely normal  for some people its scary to even make the appointment for therapy  it can be overwhelming to think about talking to a stranger about very personal information and thats exactly what we challenge you to do  it can take quite a while to feel more comfortable with your counselor and the topics you discuss  the more you show up despite your anxieties and talk about things that scare you the less likely it is that you will feel nervous and shaky beforehand depending on your expectations for sessions  it could even be something you bring up to your counselor to process how that feels to you and maybe some reasons why that may be happening  theres nothing wrong with feeling scared and i think its courageous of you to keep going  sometimes feeling anxiety means we are doing something important to us it seems as if maybe therapy holds some pretty big meaning for you
498,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,sure why notits nervewracking to go to a man or woman youve never met before and who is a total stranger that you are paying to take an interest in your life  youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions the man or woman with you and the man or woman sitting across from you  id listen to those feelingswouldnt it not be best to go to those around you that do provide comfort and aid first  wouldnt it be better to attend to those of faith around you who have love to offer first  wouldnt it be better to go to your family and loved ones first might try that see if your nervousness evaporates
499,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,its very normal to be nervous going into therapy you are being vulnerable and honest which is always scary no matter how many times you do it the best part about therapy is that the more you go the more confident you are in your ability to work through those difficult feelings and while you still may sometimes get nervous you will have confidence too
500,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,it depends on your definition of normal i would say that the average client i see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions and especially at the beginning i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessionsin my opinion a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from talking about yourself relating to another something else i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process learn from and move through to a more peaceful place if that is what is being sought
501,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics that said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you
502,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,ive gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime i walk in i get nervous and shaky is this normal should i still be feeling like this,anxiety,it takes a lot of courage to go to therapy  i have gone myself as a counselor and know what that feeling is like this is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist this might be something to bring up to your therapist and openly discuss scary to do but its ok this may even relieve some of your anxiety  if it continues you may want to consider trying another therapist as this one may not be the best fit for you

519,how can i help myself and change my behavior,ive hit my head on walls and floors ever since i was young i sometimes still do it but i dont exactly know why    i have anxiety and i had a rough childhood but now ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but i dont know how to stop or even why im doing it    how can i help myself to change my behavior,anxiety,hello i have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you in other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of kneejerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior do you feel good after you have done it the behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so i would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury if none exists this obviously doesnt excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your sidewhen we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place in the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated no closer to solving the issue when we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions so the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at ussometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm wouldnt you agree so i would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunityreach out if you need helpthere will likely be a hand there waiting for you
520,how can i help myself and change my behavior,ive hit my head on walls and floors ever since i was young i sometimes still do it but i dont exactly know why    i have anxiety and i had a rough childhood but now ill start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but i dont know how to stop or even why im doing it    how can i help myself to change my behavior,anxiety,the best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the anxiety this is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety this takes a therapist trained in cbt you will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head help you deal with the underlying cause of this and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior youll learn coping skillsyou mention having a rough childhood anyone who has experienced trauma like this especially longterm ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind definitely does not need exposure therapy which is what is recommended for phobias you need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapyyou are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is good luck with your healing journey
521,do i have an anger problem,when i get frustrated or upset it becomes extremely difficult to keep my voice down i also instantly cry and tend to have anxiety attacks what can i do to try and control it,anxiety,im going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpfulwhat im reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation  anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way whether or not the situation is truly a threat  the part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us so we dont get to decide what emotions we respond withit does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety maybe even underlying the anger  without knowing the context its hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial  theres many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your pathif you do decide to see a therapist most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger  sometimes theres a strong set of beliefs that when activated are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior  trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play  emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time  therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need whether thats with somatic work work at the level of belief or schemas or otherwisehitting it at these deeper layers can unpair andor decrease emotional responses  it all takes work and time so dont get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped forwhat we know though is that the brain is very capable of change even if its painful   hope this gives you a helpful place to start from
522,im feeling overwhelmed,my two adult sons live with me one has been having panic attacks and hasnt been able to work for over  months he doesnt want to get help im feeling so overwhelmed what can i do,anxiety,my very first thought is this is so much to carry on your own  a mothers instinct is to care for her children so i can imagine how hard it must be to see your son in pain and struggling  i hear a ping of helplessness in there as well  thats heavymy question is who is supporting you  i know nothing about the context but i wonder if the role you hold often is that of caretaker  it may not be that the endallbeall answer is to be cared for but the absence of care or even selfcare can seem like we are only existing for others  sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edgethe pressureof all that is overwhelmingdespite that it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is providing a steady stream of stress for you which would be so difficult  i dont think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences good or bad  just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help  perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know hes struggling which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles  men often avoid therapy because its seen as weak andor means you need help  planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do as hard as that isas far as supporting goes theres much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that  if you are seeing him in the midst of panic the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him  maybe that means being there physically or continuing to give him encouragement along the way eg you got this i know this is hard etc  if you arent present for the attacks but hes telling you about them you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward  panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover  remember that you also need to recover here too  its very painful to watch someone you love panic  what might you need thereof course counseling can be a great place to work through that stress and overwhelm  that time is all for you to be heard and understood  you deserve to have someone there for you too
523,how can i be less anxious around new people,i have developed bad social anxiety within the last year and i just cant stand to be around people i recently got a new girlfriend and she is extremely close to her large family and wants me to be around them all of the time my last visit with them i was quiet and uncomfortable and she got mad,anxiety,take small steps each day go around a few people  take a walk and smile or wave at others  strike up a conversation in the grocery aisle  think of topics you enjoy and would like to share could talk about to break the ice maybe call some friends you once had and reconnect go at a pace that feels comfortable and in time you could release the reclusive energy to embrace a more social you      i also wanted to share this short digital book with you the anxiety antidote
524,how can i be less anxious around new people,i have developed bad social anxiety within the last year and i just cant stand to be around people i recently got a new girlfriend and she is extremely close to her large family and wants me to be around them all of the time my last visit with them i was quiet and uncomfortable and she got mad,anxiety,i think what you are describing is pretty common  even people without social anxiety have a hard time talking to their partners familyit can feel overwhelmingone thing about social anxiety is that it creates avoidance behavior  you may be avoiding conversation so you dont embarrass yourself or say something wrong or maybe even feel like people dont like you  the truth is that those are just simply fears  you may overanalyze how people react when you put yourself out there but we arent that great at reading what people are actually thinking based on body language unless we really know the person  the challenge here is to avoid that avoidant behaviortalk to people  you dont have to talk to everybody all at once  just find a person you feel safeish with someone that seems pretty nice and open  its ok to have anxiety about talking to people and its even ok if they know you are anxious  social anxiety can cause us to think too much about how we respond which can make conversations seem choppy and unnatural  pay attention to the way you respond to people you have less or no anxiety talking withwhat does this look like for you  you can try to bring some of that to your conversations with her family  or with anyone reallyanother thing to know is that its normal to change our conversational style to fit who we are talking with  what that doesnt mean is being a completely different personits still totally ok to be you  its just like applying a different filter based on the situation  some of that will work itself out the more you practice and the more you put yourself out there  its tough to know what the boundaries are of expression sometimes so be patient with yourself  we all make many mistakes socially but thats necessary to learn about ourselves  give yourself that chance

526,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said im scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c
527,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,it is commendable that you have acknowledged the fact that you have this fear and that you want to overcome it   micro steps doing a little bit each day to get closer to your goal of overcoming it  working thru a list of ministeps that you can accomplish until you are fully immersed in your fear and overcoming it  as you accomplish each step along the way implementing micro rewards so you can feel a sense of accomplishment and reward at each interval helps to want to keep going forward  immersive therapy could help in this area
528,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,everyone has fears whatever your fear is it can be helpful to breakdown the thing that creates anxiety or fear into small steps for instance lets say you are afraid of speaking in public if your goal would be to one day speak to a room of people you would start by creating a list of lesser fears that would eventually lead to the main fear of speaking in public you could start your list with things that might be less anxietyproducing such as asking for help at a store or speaking up in class or at work if something is bothering you as you buildup to what you fear the most you will have taken baby steps while assessing whether or not what you feared most was as bad as you thought it would be if it wasnt that will help boost your confidence and help move you to the next step this is called an exposure hierarchy and it is something you can do on your own or with the help of a counselor
529,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,i think its super brave to want to face your fears so you are already moving in a great directionno matter if your fear is something rational eg fear of spiders or something that seems irrational eg fear of clocks there is always a reason your brain has considered the thing you fear to be a threat  having a fear of spiders makes sense because in evolutionary terms we need to fear things that could harm us  on the other hand fearing clocks may seem irrational without context however if you experienced something traumatic while listening to the ticking of a clock throughout the event your brain may equate clocks with danger  the reason for this is clear in much of the neuroscience research we have available  in our brains we have amygdalae which are basically just the watch dogs of the brain  they are incredibly good at scanning our environment for any threats whether or not we perceive those threats as rational because this part of the brain does not operate via logicand it shouldnt  if we sense danger because theres a bear in our presence we dont need logic to survivewe need to just respond in ways that keep us safe  if something really terrifying happens to us our brains burn that all that information into the amygdalae including any peripheral information  this is why we can fear things that really arent innately scary like clocksmoving through something you fear isnt easy  it can be very emotionally difficult and feel pretty awful  the good news is working with fears is one of the most researched areas of psychology and there are many evidencebased techniques that can helpone of the best techniques for changing the brains response is exposure  this technique involves exposing yourself little by little to the very thing you fear  the reason this is so effective is because the amygdalae can only learn via experience  if you avoid what you fear that teaches your brain that that object or situation is dangerous and over time that only strengthens the fear  conversely if you expose yourself to something you fear and sit through a full fear response eventually your anxiety returns to your baseline which sends the message that the object or situation is not dangerousto begin with exposure first its important to have some mindfulness techniques built up  this can be deep breathing muscle tensionrelaxation etc  its important to know that this is in place for relaxation not to distract from the exposure process because you really want to feel that anxiety to wake up the amygdalaeyour brain cant learn a new response if you distract from the anxiety  theres countless videos and recordings on youtube as well as apps like calm or headspace that can teach some of those techniquesnext you can create a fear hierarchy  start with things connected to your fear that serve as triggers but dont completely overwhelm you  for example if you have a fear of spiders you may start with pictures of spiders then videos then fake plastic spiders seeing a spider in person and finally touching a spider nonpoisonous  this is a very simple listsome people have many many triggers associated with their fears and thats normal  when you have your list you can scale each trigger by how much anxiety it gives you  so on a scale from  if seeing pictures of spiders puts you at a  then your goal for that part of the hierarchy is to cut it in half to  meaning you cut your anxiety in half  sometimes this can take multiple exposures with the same trigger though exposure is very powerful and tends to be a much quicker process than most people think  i know this is a lot of information to take in and i hope it all makes sense  its not all you can do but its so effective  and of course it is best when you are getting assistance from a counselor if you feel that you need that kind of support  a counselor would be able to actually do some insession mindfulness and exposure techniques with you depending on the fear to help prepare you for doing it on your own
530,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,your fear may have deeper roots within your sense of who you are than you realize   fears are sometimes irrational so that logic doesnt get rid of themthink about whether you felt secure and confident as a child  also did any major bad events happen to you with other people or situations when you were growing upoften these overwhelming situations of childhood stay with us as fears of situations in our adult lives  if the root of the problem w the fear is from long ago then probably a therapist who can ask you questions which help you remember upsetting childhood circumstances may help you to dissolve the current fearanother possibility is cbt cognitive behavior therapy which teaches people short term mantras to do something which is safe say being a passenger in a commercial airplane which feels frightening to a personcbt is short term and results are limited to specific fears  it is a much quicker approach than selfunderstanding
531,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,fear is a part of life in fact our five main emotions are joy fear sadness shame and anger we tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of those emotions and the more we do that the more we set ourselves up for failure and disappointment as a result of viewing our human emotions as bad or wrong we often get caught up in a trap of thinking we have to overcome them or get rid of them before we can do what matters to us in reality you can do what is important to you while having your fears my question for you is what would you do if this fear was completely gone what behaviors would you have if you were the ideal you what skills knowledge or personal qualities would you develop what kind of relationships would you havei imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you you cant do it until the fear is gone i challenge you to do the following exercisewhat is a goal you would like to achieve example i would like to change careerswhat actions are necessary to complete this goal example see a career counselor to determine my ideal career go back to schoolget a certification network with others in my desired industrywhat thoughts feelings or urges might get in my way example thoughts of what if i fail im not smart enough i cant do it im too busy to put energy into this feelings of fear shame excitement urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking actionit would be helpful to remind myself that example it is natural to have these thoughts feelings and urges but i can take action anyway i deserve to have a fulfilling lifethe smallest and easiest step i can take now example research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersthe time day and date that i will take that first step is example tonight at pm at least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down i hope this helps
532,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,this answer could be very different depending on the fear the degree of it and what it connects toi wonder the followingon a scale of  to  how upset anxious or scared to you get when you think about overcoming this if its more than a  i would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your areaa lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was selfprotective and important do you know where your fear started if you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way talk with someone like a therapist about itif it is something that you know is irrational for example fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing is there some part of that that you are not afraid ofi really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time if it does consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to youalso the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you dont want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction
533,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,biologically fear is designed to protect us from harm fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation a phobia however is different you used the term fear rather than phobia a phobia is an irrational fear  meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing if your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help this consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges people who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible if overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome iteveryone has fears or things that make them nervous public speaking asking a person out fear of failure examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear when you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue a lot of times it is a selfesteem issue you may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out whats causing it and deal with the real issue some fears are caused by trauma someone with ptsd is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldnt notice or react to in cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse if there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear i strongly urge you to seek a therapist  not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims
534,overcoming fears,i have a fear of something and i want to face that fear to overcome it but i dont know how what can i do,anxiety,hello and thank you for your question overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we arent afraid anymore but sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them there are some options you can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment what kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing for example if you have a general phobia about something they may use various techniques to help you manage it   there are different websites and even some selfhelp books that you can use to try to overcome your fears when it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias exposure therapy wellstudied and proven to work a therapist would help you with this but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself i am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools httppsychologytoolsanxietyhtmlsome colleagues may offer you some other types of advice be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc

542,i have difficulty with communication,i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,anxiety,a good way to start is the language or self talk that is happening inside your mind  looking at your question when it is said that the presentations make me feel stress you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self  the presentations cannot give or take away your stress thats something only you can do and you can do it   what language can you change in your self talk  for example are you saying i cant speak in front of an audience ill fail  that sounds a lot different than i studied my butt off and if i practice speaking out loud i can ace this presentation  although this is a short answer i do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence

544,i have difficulty with communication,i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,anxiety,i was the very same way when i was in graduate school  it makes sense that speaking in front of others would be scary because all of the attention is on you and you probably have expectations to meet each time including your ownpractice is the best way to build confidence before a speech  feeling prepared reduces anxiety for speaking just like it would for taking a testyou are solidifying the pathways in your brain that store and recall the information you need to know and speak aboutremember that its pretty normal to feel increased anxiety before and during a speech  its something that matters to you so your body is trying to prepare you to fight through it  it can often feel like your body is working against you when it is actually doing quite the oppositealso remember that people typically are not aware of how anxious you are  they cannot hear your heart racing they dont have access to your racing thoughts or insecurities and they cannot feel the butterflies in your stomach  when you practice your speech practice appearing confident as well  identify a couple focal points where you practice and pretend those are people  confident posture and eye contact can help you feel more confident about what you are speaking about  when you get to the actual speech have a couple focal points that you switch your gaze to every few seconds  people will perceive that as confidence even if you arent looking directly into everyones eyes which can be intimidatingdont forget to breathe  taking a few deep breaths can send the message to your brain that what you are about to do is not dangerousyou are safe  youll still feel anxiety but thats ok  during your presentation you can continue that in a sense by speaking slower  it may seem like you are talking too slowly but when you are anxious its actually a natural response to talk too fasttry to visualize yourself doing well and remind yourself that you can make it through a presentation  when its over give yourself that credit
545,i have difficulty with communication,i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,anxiety,first of all way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone you are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time in the meantime do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation do your work ahead of time so that you feel wellinformed on your topic and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing do your presentation in the mirror while you are driving if it wont distract you from the road and practice in front of a friend on the day of the presentation eat a balanced meal get a pep talk from a supportive friend use deep breathing to keep your body calm and remind yourself that you are prepared you got this
546,i have difficulty with communication,i am a really shy person im currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident how can i get more confident,anxiety,have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class   the more confident you feel in a safe space the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger groupgiving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication   it has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearlypractice practice and practice until you see yourself improve in how you presentalso keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxiousanxiety heightens fear so whatever concerns you have check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivitygood luck

558,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,theres a lot of layers there to your situation and im focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others  one layer is the daunting news that your son has autism  many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis  the vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap ones head around  taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful  some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child and others may experience guilt  if either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you it may be worth working through them with a therapist  a support group list is available through wwwautismspeaksorg and may help connect you with others raising children with autisma second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in  the trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others  engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships

   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,take small steps each day go around a few people  take a walk and smile or wave at others  strike up a conversation in the grocery aisle  think of topics you enjoy and would like to share could talk about to break the ice maybe call some friends you once had and reconnect go at a pace that feels comfortable and in time you could release the reclusive energy to embrace a more social you  this video could be beneficial also   how to make friends as an adult
560,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,i have to start off by saying that i admire you so much for your devotion to your son and the fact that you stopped working to focus on and care for him that cannot have been easy not to mention being in an abusive relationship where you are made to fear for your physical but also your emotional safety you may or may not believe this but it sounds like youre a really strong person and it also sounds like you want to feel better about yourself and be social with others however you dont know how to do that right now because like any normal person who has been harmed by someone and who has felt unsafe by someone you may not trust so easily you are out of practice with being around others and having healthy relationships and because of what you have been through you get anxiety from being social the fact that you want to change that though is a huge positive was there ever a time when you didnt feel nervous around others was there ever a time when you did feel comfortable around people what goes through your mind when the idea of socializing comes up these are some questions to explore in order to determine how you could feel more comfortable around people in order to really answer your question i feel i need more information from you in the meantime though the first step is to recognize that you are not abnormal in your feelings quite the opposite and to not put pressure on yourself when you feel nervous around others my suggestion is to seek therapy so that someone can make more specific recommendations by asking you some more questions as more information is needed to really assist best of luck
561,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,its understandable that you would feel this way considering what you have been and are going through with your son and the past abusive relationship it sounds like you got into a pattern of being home with your son and not around others for a while so understandably  you have gotten used to this lifestyle that makes it harder but not impossible to get back out there and be around other people and begin to feel more comfortable around others again you can do this by taking baby steps take it slow try reaching out to one person who you know and like and maybe meet them for coffee try putting yourself in a setting that feels non threatening to outside your home  and is something you can also enjoy even with your son depending on his needs it will take time as you probably want to process your feelings about what you went through but you can get there good luck
562,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,it might be helpful to have a good understanding of the why in terms of feeling nervous around people or the difficulty in developing more comfort if your discomfort is somehow related to your sons diagnosis or your lack of employment or an abusive relationship you were in and maybe embarrassed about that is important to understand and get clarity around when we can understand on a deep level what is happening for us ie where does fear come into this and whats it about we can give ourselves empathy everyone struggles in some aspect so to not necessarily think of yourself as pathological is a first step sometimes being around people can trigger an anxiety related to being good enough that goes back a ways in our history if any of the above is true it would need acknowledgement and care from you as opposed to shaming that experience in the hopes it would just go away because this experience is very real for you
563,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,id wonder first if you were still in the same home and neighborhood where you raised your son and experienced the abuse in many ways we react to our environments  and if youre still surrounded by neighbors who didnt reach out when they heard your ex yelling or offer assistance and resources when your son acted differently than his peers it might make sense that youre more timid around folks it might also be worth thinking about where your bar is set do you want to be as comfortable around people as you were before your recent circumstances or find your new normal and connect only with people who raise you up and bolster your selfesteem you have the right to be both cautious if youre still surrounded by the same folks and environment and discerning  only connecting with people who will be supportive all the best
564,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,it sounds like you have taken on a caretaker role for a while as well as experienced some pretty severe interpersonal trauma  it makes sense that you would feel nervous around people  working through the trauma of an abusive relationship in itself can be a difficult process  and then to add on the caretaker part can make things even more difficult  first off you may want to seek support to work through what you have experienced  many cities offer support with survivors of domestic violence and there is a hotline to help with this  as well as online resources  processing the isolation of this relationship as well as working with your son can help to overcome the anxiety related to others  accessing autism support networks may be of support as well  other parents that will understand your experiences are a good and tend to be safer place to start in attempting to connect to othersvery importantly go slow and be kind to yourself as you begin to adapt to a new life of allowing others to care for you as you so clearly have for others
565,i want to feel more comfortable around people,"my son was diagnosed with autism a few years ago and i stopped working so that i could take care of him i also was dealing with an abusive relationship mentally physically and emotionally now i live like a recluse and i always feel nervous around people
   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,i would look at  getting engaged with a support network of individuals who may also have autistic children  they will understand some of the things that you are experiencing at home and you may also find someone who feels that same way as you if you have not sought professional counseling for the abusive relationship i would seek out a therapist who can help you process through it so you do not repeat similar choices in your next relationship

   how can i feel more comfortable around other people",anxiety,probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your lifehave you told some of the people in your life about the many changes youve been through   it is possible people sense something different about you and arent sure whether to ask or not ask questionsalso understand what type of qualities youd like to offer and receive in a friendship   given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time the way you socialize will changestart with one person whom youre pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your lifeas a result of how this interaction goes how you decide to spend your time together what youll discuss you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other peoplethen you can consider if youre ready to add others into your world

   how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career relationship status etc",anxiety,one way to find peace and contentment is to selfgenerate the love acceptance validation and belonging you crave from others inside yourself   working thru how you came to a point where the sum total of your worth is based on others opinions of you and how your career relationship status etc became a determining factor in how you value your worth  society often uses these variables and tools to measure someones worth and our worth is not wrapped in those things especially not those things alone i would like to share these two videos never leave yourself signs

   how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career relationship status etc",anxiety,it sounds to me like you would benefit from mindfulness practice and selfcompassion practice what is mindfulnessmindfulness in short is the practice of bringing a nonjudgmental awareness to the present moment this meditative tradition stems from buddhism and was brought to the west by zen teachers who made them more accessible for westerners if youve ever taken a yoga class or played a guided meditation wherein you were encouraged to focus on your breath without changing it feel the sensations on your skin and bring awareness to tension in your body youve practiced mindfulnesswhat is selfcompassion we often hear about selfesteem as something we need to increase for optimal mental health the problem with selfesteem is that it ebbs and flows based on external factors  such as if you have a good job or if you have a romantic relationship a much better place to put your energy into is developing selfcompassion which is being kind to yourself no matter what your circumstances look like over time selfcompassion acts as the building blocks for selflove which no one or nothing can take away from you why develop these practices when you can practice mindfulness and selfcompassion in tandem then you bring more acceptance and understanding to your life circumstances instead of judging yourself for not having the perfect life i hope this is helpful and i wish you all the best if youre interested in this type of approach a holistic therapist can help you learn these tools and put them into daily practice

   how can i learn to be content and at peace with myself regardless of my career relationship status etc",anxiety,moving on from a long term relationship can be difficult  sometimes we can lose a sense of who we are because in a way we have become defined by the relationship itself  so when we begin to move on and see other people our sense of identity may be obscured  the tendency is to seek out validation to give us a feeling of worthiness   that its ok to move on and be happy   this is a relatively normal reaction  its important to treat yourself with kindness and compassion through this time in your life  mindful selfcompassion can be a great way to begin the process of getting that sense of who you are back and what you want in a relationship  i think its important to look back learn what you can from the previous relationship and become a better person for it in the future  at the same time taking the necessary time to nuture yourself on a mind body and spirit level selfcompassion allows you to turn inward and except all facets of who you are  it improves your capacity for love vulnerability emotional openness social interconnectedness and selfrespect  my philosophy is holistic collaborative and accepting  the cornerstone of my treatment philosophy is mindfulness and other evidenced based integrative modalities  i work as your ally to help you cultivate abundant selfcompassion in your life so that you can have the types of relationships you want

578,i always fear that people are judging me,i know this fear doesnt make sense how can i overcome it,anxiety,we often feel people are judging us because we are judging ourselves  investigating how you feel about yourself your own self confidence can be a segway into why you feel others are judging you and also why others opinions matter and if you are using that as the scale by which you estimate the total sum of your worth
579,i always fear that people are judging me,i know this fear doesnt make sense how can i overcome it,anxiety,your fear may not seem rational but that doesnt mean it doesnt make sense  theres  a reason for why this fear happens for you  most everyone has this fear because we are social animals and need to care what others think of us sometimes  when it becomes a bigger issue is when it keeps you from enjoying your life or interferes with your functioningdo you think it may have to do with uncertainty of what others may be thinking of you or that people will ultimately reject you sometimes when we dont know what others think we assume they judge  this is especially true if youve experienced direct judgment or bullying in your past or if a significant parent or caregiver in your life made you feel shamewhen i have a client that often fears others are judging them i have them list out the evidence they see to support that  what evidence is there to tell you that someone is judging you  if you take something as evidence also ask yourself if they behave the same with other people  when we fear judgment we often microanalyze and misinterpret peoples body language to mean something it doesnt  it can also help to make a mental or actual list of other possibilities  most people are concerned about what others are thinking of them so its possible people you interact with are wondering what you think of them  its also possible they are judging you positivelywhat are some things in this category that people have told you about how they see you  sometimes taking feedback from people closest to you whom you trust can be the most accurate representation of how others may see you  counseling could be a great option as well because i guarantee these fears will show up in sessions and thats good  it gives you a chance to process them with someone who will help you understand these fears and may even give you genuine feedback about how they perceive you at the right time  it can be very healing
580,i always fear that people are judging me,i know this fear doesnt make sense how can i overcome it,anxiety,no it makes sense consider today how social media has impacted the mind and heart of manis it not so extraordinarily easy to make one appear stellar on social media today  heh heh ive long since joked that the definition of a party is  a series of photos to lie withwhen i peel back the awareness of others judgment what i find is excitement of wanting to express themselves tooits funny how america is one of the few lands on the planet where folks are able to mess up and try it again on most other places if you mess up there is such deep shame in it that it may lead to one taking ones life
581,i always fear that people are judging me,i know this fear doesnt make sense how can i overcome it,anxiety,stop caring about what you imagine people are thinking about youreally this is the simple and complicated answer to feel better about your situationmaybe someone is judging you maybe someone isnt judging youuntil the person tells you directly what they dont like about you theres nothing you can doit is okay that the fear doesnt make sense most fears dont make sense

628,i dont like going outside anymore,i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,anxiety,social anxiety has skyrocketed since covid  plus could be trauma or ptsd  maybe you are a known person and feel safer not going so much out in public  i understand as a known person in my field depending on where i am it can be a bit much  or maybe the things you found joy in before are not as much of an interest  it could be your age or menapause hormones and injury  so many things could be in play depending on the client and their lifestyle  always best to get a check up  see if there is under lining medical issues and then go from there
629,i dont like going outside anymore,i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,anxiety,there could be a few reasons thats happening  if you are afraid of leaving your home and going other places that may be an anxiety response  not all people who feel this way have all the criteria for agoraphobia but that doesnt mean its not hard and doesnt interfere with your life  this may be triggered by a fear of being around people or people seeing you  it may also feel like leaving the safety of your home is too overbearing without a clear indication as to why  when it is the latter its typically brought on by an anxiety disorder such as panic disorderif you have lost interest in going outside that may be a very different clinical picture  did you used to enjoy getting outside but now feel like it is no longer enjoyable  have you lost interest in other things that you used to find joy in  when depression is the culprit it can feel like you dont get excited about things you used to like which is also accompanied at times by feelings of worthlessness hopelessness sleep and eating changes and frequent sadness  its not uncommon for anxiety and depression symptoms to coexist so you may be experiencing a little or maybe a lot of both  if you feel like you need to speak to somebody about what you are going through counselors can usually help and with the option of telehealth online counseling you dont have to leave your home to do soif you dont have access to a counselor your primary doctor can also help you understand your symptoms better and maybe even recommend some other options for you
630,i dont like going outside anymore,i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,anxiety,one reason may have to do with physical anxiety symptoms this is common for people who experience panic attacks or physical anxiety symptoms often it begins with just avoiding certain places or activities where the symptoms happen over time its common for it to spread to more and more places and situations until many people get in the habit of not leaving their home at all in an effort to avoid the symptoms
631,i dont like going outside anymore,i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,anxiety,the short answer i could give is that we dont know why its happening the longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears or anxieties that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside but any sort of exploration about this almost has to begin with an agreement within you and all of your feelings thats its not something to be ashamed of if we are ashamed of any of our behaviors then we lose the ability to sit with them and see where they are coming from this could be something that can be worked through in therapy and specifically with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and more specifically agoraphobia
632,i dont like going outside anymore,i dont understand why this is happening why do i feel this way,anxiety,the first step to answer your question is to reflect on what is going on in your life overall  if youre in the midst of severe stress whether within your relationship or effort to establish a relationship upheaval in family dynamics some type of significant loss like a job or someone with whom you feel closely attached then you may simply be creating the solitude which is necessary to better understand and absorb the meaning of these changesi assume you mean you are by yourself when you are indoorswhat you write sounds like youre not happy with this recent urge rather than that you and someone or others are having great and fun times togetherone way to encourage yourself to go back outdoors is to connect w a friend or search for an interest within you to developthis way with either of these youd feel a little bit of motivation to join and get more involved with either of these

   people keep telling me i have anxiety and im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road this is all new to me what can i do",anxiety,one thing to know is that anxiety is not a bad thingit is the bodys natural response that mobilizes us to action  if you think about it in terms of preparation your anxiety is helping your body to be ready to perform through something important to you or protect you from harm  a question worth asking is what are you really afraid of happening if you have an anxiety attack while driving  are you worried you wont make it to your new job  are you scared of letting your family down  do you fear you will crash  knowing what you fear will happen because of your anxiety can help to determine where your mental focus would be best suited  for example if you fear you wont make it to your job you can create a list of thoughts to support you through those fears eg i am capable of making it to my new job etcdespite knowing the origin of your anxiety it can still feel very scary to go through an anxiety attack  just anticipating anxiety can ironically increase your chances of experiencing it  a really great way to manage this is via mindful breathing  there are so many youtube videos and recordings of how to control your breathing in order to calm your bodys anxiety response that work best even before youve felt a spike of fear  taking time each day to practice deep breathing even for just a few minutes can be a helpful tool to grounding yourself in the present moment vs fearing the unknown doing a practice run on the route you will be taking could also send a big message to the part of your brain that creates your fear response  practicing getting to your location can reduce that fear of the unknown as well as teach your anxiety that you performed the drive once and nothing bad happened in response your anxiety doesnt feel a need to set off your alarm so loudsomething really important to remember is that having anxiety or an anxiety attack does not mean you are in danger  anxiety can feel awful but it will always come back down  give yourself credit that you can make it through any response your body hasafter all thats what your body was built to do

   people keep telling me i have anxiety and im terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road this is all new to me what can i do",anxiety,anxiety often occurs when big or unexpected changes come to our lives like having new jobs relocating or assuming new roles notice if your anxiety feels like excitement concerns or fearit seems like you are excited about your new job but worried because others are telling you that you have anxiety   lets notice how others input is affecting your thoughts and maybe causing more anxiety that you may really have   if you are indeed experiencing anxiety that does not mean that you will have panic attacks   but if you are experiencing panic attacks or suffer them at some point you could learn how to reduce them either with therapy or medicationyou can learn how to process it depending what triggers it and channel it in a useful way  for example you could plan a schedule around your new job and be meticulous about it because you are worried about how your new job may affect your routine or you could feel overwhelmed with your schedule focus on the feeling but not do anything about it  notice the difference  the key is in recognizing if you are anxious about something that you can change or have control over it and take action if you do and recognizing when you cannot control things and be ok with not being in controli teach clients how to use meditation and cognitive reframing techniques to help calm anxiety symptoms  if you are interested in engaging in counseling or teletherapy you may contact me at i wish you success on your new journeyestoy preocupada por mi nuevo trabajola gente me dice que tengo ansiedad y estoy aterrorizada de tener un ataque de pánico en la carretera  esto es nuevo par a mí que puedo hacerla ansiedad ocurre comúnmente cuando llegan cambios grandes o inesperados en nuestras vidas como tener un nuevo empleo mudarse o asumir nuevos rolesal parecer estás emocionada por tu nuevo trabajo pero preocupada por que otros te dicen que tienes ansiedad  notemos como la opinión de otros esta influenciando tus pensamientos y tal vez te puede estar causando más ansiedad de lo que realmente tienes  si realmente estas pasando por un periodo de ansiedad no es necesario que vayas a experimentar ataques de pánico  pero si ya los haz experimentado puedes utilizar terapia o medicamentos para controlarlosnota si tu ansiedad se siente emocionante preocupada o temerosa  puedes aprender a procesar estos sentimientos dependiendo que pensamiento los causen y canalizar la ansiedad de manera productiva  por ejemplo te puedes enfocar en organizar una agenda porque te preocupa como tu nuevo empleo afectara tu rutina diaria  o te puedes sentir agobio respecto a cómo tu trabajo afecta tu rutina y no hace nada más que preocuparte constantemente  notas la diferencia  la clave está en saber cuándo te preocupas  por algo que puedes cambiar y tomar acción vs cuando te preocupas  por algo que no puedes cambiar y aceptar que no lo puedes cambiarle enseño a mis pacientes a  usar técnicas de meditación y re enfoque cognitivo para manejar síntomas de ansiedad  y desorden de pánico  si te interesa una cita de consejería o teleterapia me puedes contactar al  mucho éxito en tu nueva jornada

656,i feel burned out,i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,anxiety,i would first say that those are difficult thoughts and feelings that sound exhausting i cant image how this must feel but i can assure you that you are not alone these are common experiences in our society where we are made to feel as though we must go go go especially in the current world situation even simple things can feel overwhelming i believe that starting with baby steps such as taking even  minutes for yourself daily to be in the quiet and reflect can be helpful recognizing that even small selfcare steps such as drinking more water eating healthier foods or taking a hot bath can be helpful to relieve stress
657,i feel burned out,i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,anxiety,its ok that you are going through that even though it is probably very miserable  feeling burnt out is usually a sign that something is out of balance in our lives and we need to make some adjustmentshow are boundaries set up in your life  if these are lacking in your work life social life or personal life that could be draining  this can be all too true for people that feel like putting up boundaries is selfish or that others will reject you if you do however realistic boundaries are super healthy for both yourself and others for example i have a boundary on how many people i see in a week and when i discuss workrelated issuesthis helps me take care of myself in ways that make me a better counselor and lets other people know exactly what i expect so theres no guessinganother question to consider is what are you doing to recharge from stressors  we tend to get so caught up in responsibilities that we miss opportunities to slow down  we try to put a blind eye to how we are feeling and just push through but our bodies will tell us when its too much whether thats through physical pain emotional pain or both consider the metaphor of a car  if you are low on gas your gas light comes on  you can keep driving but eventually youre going to need to stop and fill up no matter how badly you want to make it to the next exit anxiety and other feelings popping up may be a sign you are just too overwhelmed and need to rechargehow you attempt that may look different from others  what brings you joy  is there a person or people that recharge you  or do you recharge better doing something alone  if you feel its a struggle to find answers to these questions try to remember things that have peaked your interests and brought you joy in the past  it could be something as simple as taking a walk creating something baking etc  it can be a process so no matter how quickly you want to move through this just be patient with yourself
658,i feel burned out,i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,anxiety,does it help to put a name to the experience you are having where you first said ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious you then say that you are feeling burnt out which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like no reason perhaps you are feeling burnt out that is a big deal and please try not to take it lightly when we get burnt out i have found that its from one of two things either we are not doing what we want or we are doing too much either of something we want or something we dont doesnt really matter once we get into doing too muchif either of those rings true for your experience try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from i wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website i dont want to do shameless promotion but i thought it could also add to helping you httpsdavidkleintherapycommyexperienceswithburnouti hope that you can also see that its not an abnormal experience
659,i feel burned out,i havent been feeling like myself lately ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious im feeling burnt out what can help me feel better,anxiety,theres no such possibility that youre upset for no reasonthe reason is not obvious not that you are feeling upset in response to nothing at allwhat can help you feel better is to be kind and gentle with yourself because this sort of approach will more likely relax your mood and mindset enough for the tension and anxiety you feel to dissipate somewhattry to understand whether certain situations or interactions remind you or feel similar to ones which distressed you beforethis may be the reason for your anxietyit is good news that you know the difference between your usual sense of yourself and that youve been away from this feelinggive yourself a little credit for understanding yourself   giving credit adds confidence and confidence will help you find the reasons and new ways to handle your anxiety
660,how can i avoid thinking much,i start thinking deeply about everything i may do or say and about anything that may happen i really want to avoid it since it really bothers me,anxiety,as you know probably very well those types of thinking patterns are energy suckers  im assuming you are often tired and dont sleep as well as you could especially as our thoughts tend to creep up on us when we are trying to fall asleepone thing to know is that those thought patterns are a protective mechanism  ruminating on what could happen and how we will respond is how we feel prepared for whats to come  in a logical sense theres so much uncertainty in life that trying to plan all that out is nearly impossible  although not a bad idea to have a game plan or rehearse how you are going to respond to conflict endlessly revisiting those things tend to take away from why we want to be prepared in the first placeto protect our wellbeing in any aspect  the trick is how to calm the brain which is so much easier said than done  to start take the time to write your thoughts down  you can do that via journaling or by splitting a piece of paper into two categories one side is helpful planning and other side unhelpful planning  the brain is a spectacular organ but sometimes we really need to see things externally to be able to process them effectively  excessive worry is really a result of pretty significant fearswhether those fears come from not feeling like you can handle situations that other people cant handle things that you will lose something important to you or that you will fail  writing about those fears could help you understand where those thoughts are coming from or you could even talk those out with a friend or counselor  sometimes someone elses feedback about our situations can change how we see things since we tend to get perpetually stuck in the same perspectivesmy last suggestion is to work on trying to stay in the present via mindfulness at least  minutes a day  its probably going to feel foreign and weird maybe even scary since you live more in the future vs the present moment  its common for the brain to respond by trying to push back into those thinking patterns but mindfulness actually increases your ability to problemsolve and see things more clearly  constant anxiety clouds us  mindfulness clears that out  and im sure you really could use a brain break
661,i cant have a drink without panicking,,anxiety,hello  theres not a lot of information here but i have a couple thoughts about what could be happening for youmy first thought is what we know about the effect of alcohol on the body  its a depressant meaning it slows down your central nervous system functioningincluding your heart rate breathing etc  it also decreases activation in the part of the brain that deals with inhibition  how that relates to panicking could be very specific to your experiences and your own bodys reaction though its a possibility that those bodily sensations trigger panic for you  if youve been in a traumatic situation in the past your body may be at a heightened level of awareness or vigilance letting your guard down common with drinking can feel too vulnerable for people with a history of trauma because the body feels open to attack without those extra layers of vigilance   so thats one possibilitythe second thought i have is that along with feeling vulnerable there may be a fear of loss of control  alcohol tends to shut down the part of the brain that basically operates as a ceo  when that area of the brain is offline more emotions are able to come through  pair that with the loss of physical control you may feel and that could be the perfect storm for a panic attackthe third thought i have is that you may just have an intolerance to alcohol  im not an expert on allergies or intolerances so if you are truly concerned about your reaction to alcohol it could be worth your time to visit a doctor  even if you dont have anything medical going on a doctor may know what direction to point you in based on your specific circumstances  keep in mind also that alcohol does not mix with many medications  if you are taking any prescription medications make sure to ask your doctor about risksside effectsinteractions  there could be some information there to make sense of your symptomskeep that curiosity going and an answer will soon come
662,how do i calm down during a panic attack,i have a panic attack at least once a week and suffer from severe anxiety,anxiety,im sorry youre going through that  panic attacks are terrifyingone thing to start with is knowing that panic attacks are not going to hurt you and your anxiety will come down with time  fighting that process can sometimes heighten symptoms because your brain wants the message of panic to be heard  some of the best ways to counter that message is through focusing on the present moment through sensations or breathing  taking deep breaths allows your body and brain to slow down sending the message that theres no present danger  focusing on the present can also send the same message as anxiety typically throws us into the what ifs of the future  if you search google or pinterest there are tons of methods you can use for thissome people prefer to focus on colors shapes smells textures etc while other prefer to pay attention to internal sensations  there are also apps that can help with these techniques such as calm and headspace  they work best when you arent in a panic attack or when you feel one coming on  if you are already at the peak of an attack they can still help it just may take a bit longer  some clients i have like to track their anxiety with a scale system  lets say you scale your anxiety at an  out of  do some breathing exercises for  minutes then scale it again  its likely the anxiety decreased at least to a  or   doing this can give you some physical proof that you have some control over your body  you can also scale it without the breathing to see how it just fluctuates on its own  anxiety will always go down and you can see that happening via numbers  this method will let you see the light at the end of the tunnelthere are other ways that might work for you via a quick google search or through therapy  keep trying new things until you find what works best for you
663,what can i do when i feel like my life is out of control,i was in a car accident and totaled my car i gave up my job of nine years to pursue school fulltime to better myself i failed a class and my boyfriend that i live with thinks im stupid and wants to break up with me i have nowhere to go and i feel like im losing everything,anxiety,doesnt sound like your boyfriend is a source of support and im really sorry to hear that  and my assumption is that the car accident was traumatic for you and still impacts you in some waysby just reading what you wrote im not sure what that impact has been on you but i get the impression that maybe you are now carless and have no reliable method of transportation to get to school or other places you need to go  maybe you are also scared to be in a vehicle  my first thought after reading this is that i wouldnt be thrilled about getting into a car if mine was totaled in an accident  it may even incite terror  none of that is your faultits an expected response to a horrible situationmy second thought was that you are obviously very committed and reliable if you had a job of nine years  not to mention brave for stepping out of the comfort of a job to pursue school fulltime  thats a giant transition that you should get so much credit for from yourself and from the people closest to you  failing doesnt mean you made the wrong decision ive failed classes as well when i was just starting out in college  it truly doesnt mean anything about youit just means that things got in the way and you can either try again or learn something about yourself or both and what you want out of an academic career  the feelings around failing may feel raw at the moment but readdress them in a couple weeks or a month and notice how your perspective may change as well as the steps you may take despite the situation  be careful of how much your boyfriend is contributing to how you feel about yourself too  im guessing you already felt pretty terrible then his words or actions rubbed it in  who do you have in your life that is compassionate toward you  if you arent sure seeking out a counselor can be really great with all the emotions of a big transition like you are going through  in the meantime focus on the things you have total control overyour breath little choices that you make throughout the day etc  mindfulness and meditation can be a way for you to get some peace and slow down from the chaos of your life and thoughts
664,what can i do when i feel like my life is out of control,i was in a car accident and totaled my car i gave up my job of nine years to pursue school fulltime to better myself i failed a class and my boyfriend that i live with thinks im stupid and wants to break up with me i have nowhere to go and i feel like im losing everything,anxiety,when we feel overwhelmed by life situations it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from  once we understand the source it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our livesfirst car accidents are common and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us   when we have an accident we feel anxious worried and may have some trauma after the accidents  if you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident talk to your doctor or therapist about it  second a lot of people fail classes tasks deadlines etc but they dont give up on their goal  we have to remember that failing is part of the learning process and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character  remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job and the courage and determination that took to do so then channel that energy back into school  third when we have problems in our relationships is helpful to look for ways to improve communication discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isnt enough interest in one of the parts or if theres verbal or emotional abuse  consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communicationat all times  focus on being kind to yourself and improving your selfesteem increase selfcare activities do more things that you enjoy meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life   at the end you are the one in control of your life and you determine who you becomequé puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida está fuera de controlestuve en un accidente de auto y fue pérdida total  deje mi trabajo de  años para completar un grado a tiempo completo  falle una clase y mi novio piensa que soy estúpida el quiere dejarme  no tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todocuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones  ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vidaprimero los accidentes de auto son comunes y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas  cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos preocupados y puede que experimentemos algún trauma  si sientes ansiedad extrema preocupación habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto  segundo muchas personas fallan clases tareas fechas de entrega pero no se rinden  tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo es lo que nos da determinación y carácter   recuerda que te impulsó a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energía en la escuela  tercero  cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias pero puede ser que la relación termine si no hay interés mutuo o si hay algún tipo de abuso   considera hablar con tu novio y establecer límites respecto a la comunicación apropiadaen todo momento enfócate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa más tiempo practicando esas actividades
665,how can i manage my budding anxiety,i have been thinking a lot about certain situations and having my worries about what others may think or say,anxiety,i think its a great idea that you are asking this question now while its early on the first thing i wonder is what age you are  at different transitions and stages in life its really common for anxieties to come out of the woodwork  first time this takes place at a greater level is during adolescence because a teens job is to figure out who they are within the context of other people  spikes in anxiety also can also occur after high school when you are leaving the nest and heading to college or the late twenties when it feels like you are expected to have your life figured out and compare to where others are in their lives  that same scenario can show up in midlife as well for different reasons depending on the person  aside from age certain circumstances can influence a jump in anxiety such as a job change switching schools moving opening a business college finals etc  take some time to explore where the anxiety might be coming from and just see what comes up  it may be something you have some control over or something that you can ask for help from someone else forespecially if its social anxiety  the more you practice social skills the more confidence youll have in the longruna metaphor i use with some people is gas for a car  anxiety is a necessary motivator for action though you get to decide where to go with that anxiety  an overfilled tank doesnt get you any further than a normallyfilled tank and more gas doesnt mean the gas is in charge of where you go  applying that to what i know about your situationhow much of that worrying is getting you somewhere how much is just extra gas and are the worries changing what you really want to do sometimes knowing the makeup of our anxiety gives us more power over how we deal with it and i think you could for sure get there with some help
666,how can i overcome social anxiety,i have a fear of talking with people i dont like to go out to social events im always worrying about someone judging me,anxiety,thanks for reaching out and asking this question  social stuff is hard  even for people that dont have diagnosed social anxiety  some research outlines that our fear of public speaking is greater than our fear of death  thats hefty  shame is often the culprit for social anxiety because we think other people will see the flaws in ourselves that we believe are there  ive had experiences where i thought the person thought something awful of me just to find out it was exactly the opposite  thats how powerful our minds can bewhat are other things that people may think of you  maybe you are very kind and easy to talk to  maybe you think differently than other people and some people enjoy hearing your perspectives  its even a possibility that they are worrying about the same things as you even if they seem very confident  confidence can be easy to fake if its how you cope with fearto work through some of that its much better to force yourself out there and have conversations  avoiding people sends the message to your brain that not only are those situations dangerous socially but that you cant handle them  the more you avoid the harder it gets and the more anxiety is created by just the thought of being around people  take it moment by moment too  thinking about all the conversations you are confronted with in a day is overwhelming  just focus on getting through each conversation and give yourself credit for doing thateven if you felt awkward embarrassed etc  social skills can be taught at any stage of life and theres always room for mistakes  no one in society communicates perfectly and you dont need to put that pressure on yourselfthe last thing id say is keep at least  people in your life that feel really good to talk tolike its not a task  talking to acquaintances and random people is not to fulfill a need for close connection unless you end up finding a great friend but more to feel like you are definitely able to handle conversations without the threat of crippling anxiety  you may even get to a place where you enjoy it sometimes  reach out to people in your life if you need extra support
667,how can i stop worrying much,i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me i really want to stop it and enjoy things,anxiety,we all experience that to a different level depending on who you ask  its actually born out of a good qualityprosocialness  when we care what others think of us we are also attuned to how we are treating them and whats socially right vs wrong  it definitely does feel like its more about ourselves howevermeaning it feels like we worry about what others think because we dont want to be socially outcast or rejected  thats also again to a certain level a healthy quality  it means you want connection  connection is crucial to mental health and according to some available research physical health  no matter how mentally healthy or socially confident you are if you care about connection youre going to care about what people think of you to an extent  so the work here is to figure out what worry is warranted vs what is just causing you suffering  a good way to tell the difference here is to write it out in list form  write out all the sociallyanxious thoughts you have and scale them from needed or helpful to unnecessary or unhelpful  some may fall in the gray area here  for example if you worry that others think you are inconsiderate so you often say sorryweed out whats actually inconsiderate vs what you feel is maybe inconsiderate because you feel like a burden to others  getting in someones personal space would warrant some worry and an apology  asking for help when you need it is something you dont have to apologize for  something else to consider here is theres probably some underlying shame  shame is a cluster of really tough feelings and if it had a voice itd say things like youre not good enough you arent likeable you are annoying and no one wants to be around you etc  those feelings typically create the worry you experience about others  shame survives and is strengthened by the attention you give to it  the more you compete with it the less powerful it becomes  sometimes that comes in the form of noticing the wonderful qualities in yourself  sometimes it takes practice putting yourself out there when its really scary  no matter what shames nemesis is connectionto yourself and to others  thats how you prove its wrong  try not to take shame at face valueif you are struggling with using these techniques or just dont know if they are right for you a counselor can help you out and give you a more individualized approach  sometimes its just figuring out that specific formula that works for you that makes all the difference  and of course counseling is built on a strong connectioni wish you all the best
668,how can i stop worrying much,i have a bad habit of thinking and worrying about what others may think of me i really want to stop it and enjoy things,anxiety,thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people places and things to let us know more about ourselves we also have an inner voice dialogue conscience etc that helps us to determine the path for us often when someone is worried about the external feedback and focuses on this as the sole source of information it can create a dependency that can become problematic balance is key to so many things in life your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek dont discount it and rely only on the voices of others
669,how can i stop repetitive thoughts and feel confident again,i have been repeating the same thought pattern for seven years and have completely lost control of any situation i am in my early s and i feel like i am trapped in my body mind soul and house because i feel embarrassed to go anywhere or talk to anyone,anxiety,theres so much help for repetitive thoughts in the counseling world  the one thing id for sure ask if we met in person is what those repetitive thought patterns look like  some repetitive thoughts are more like obsessive thoughts  for example that may mean that every time you leave a room your obsessive thought is to switch the light on and off  times  or every time you touch a door handle you think about the germs you came into contact with and washing your hands multiple times  sometimes its more about the same thoughts repeating about bad things that may happen or critical thoughts we have about ourselves  your statement about feeling confident again gives me the sense that maybe you struggle with the ways in which you think about yourselfassuming its obsessive thoughts exposure and response prevention therapy is an excellent form of treatment  typically obsessive thoughts influence compulsions which usually show up as very strict repetitive rituals in order to manage anxiety  exposure and response prevention exposes you to the things that increase anxiety while response prevention helps you to sit through that anxiety response without performing a compulsion  for example you touch a door handle  your anxiety increases  you obsess about the germs you came into contact with and have a strong urge to wash your hands multiple times  instead you sit through the anxiety let the anxiety decrease on its own and slowly unpair that anxious response with the behavior  the more you do this the more it breaks up those thinkingbehavior patterns that make you feel chained to themassuming its selfcritical thoughts cognitivebehavioral therapy can work well here  everyones brain has a default track that when met with struggle plays over and over like a broken record  the more you give into that the more it plays  the trick here is creating a competing track or turning the volume up on a track that boosts your confidence instead of shooting it down  some ways to do that are really identifying and writing down what those repetitive thoughts are  you probably already know them pretty well if they repeat often  then next to themwrite out a line that has an heir of confidence andor gentleness  for example if your repetitive thought is that you are a failure you may write out a sentence that is something like  i may be struggling greatly with this situation yet i am still trying super hard to get better and thats definitely not a failure  every separate repetitive thought can have its own competing sentence  initially these new thoughts will feel weird foreign and maybe even like they dont do anything  give it time  the repetitive thoughts have had years to grow so these new thoughts need time too  they are literally new pathways in the brain and the more they are traveled the stronger they will getim also sensing that theres a combination of anxiety and depression  i would assume that you are probably feeling pretty cut off from the world if you dont want to talk to anyone  that can be so lonely and isolating  because connection is basically crucial for healing it may be very beneficial for you to see a counselor or find a support that feels safe to you  counselors are usually trained very well in these types of issues and some offer telehealth if you are having trouble leaving your home  it might feel scary and strange at first but you are in a lot of pain and deserve healinghope this helps a bit  go with your gut and do what you feel is right for you  i wish you all the best
670,what should i do about my stress before track meets,i am on the track and softball team my school is small so i play all four sports it offers i feel obligated to do track because im not a horrible runner and my dad wants me to the catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of i get sick and cry,anxiety,seems like you have some confidence in your track abilities but feel pressured by your dad to continue something you dont really enjoy  are you maybe worried about disappointing your dad or is it something about track itself that upsets you or overwhelms your bodywhen we try to push through stuff thats too much for our bodies whether thats physical or emotional that stress will show up no matter how hard we try to bury it   sometimes that shows up as crying or irritation other times that shows up as physical symptoms   for you it could be both  based on the symptoms showing up days before a meet it could be more emotional since it comes so long beforehand  im assuming you are very active already so extra exercise probably isnt too helpful and may only put more stress on your body  do you feel like you ever get a chance to truly relax  always running on overdrive with little gas is exhausting  try giving yourself permission during the period before the track meets to just do something that slows you down  doesnt have to be super longeven  minutes a day could give your brain and body a very needed break from that gogogo lifestylepay attention to your sleep as well  i dont know anything about your nightly routine but if you are struggling to sleep that could enhance the symptoms of anxiety before your meets  some calm activities before bed could help hereof course you could try talking with your dad about whats happening if you think hed be able to support your needs  thats not always possible and if not no worries  theres a lot you can do to get through whats happening  if you have another caregiver in the picture that feels approachable you could talk to himher about how you are feeling  also take a look at strategies for performance anxiety online  even if you dont have that particular type of anxiety the strategies are really great and can at least help a little if you are still engaging in track

673,what can i do about my severe social anxiety when my family doesnt believe in it,,anxiety,im so sorry you arent being taken seriously  i hope you have at least one person in your life that believes you and will listen to you  sometimes when family members dont give us a chance to be heard we can find someone in our lives that makes us feel like we matter  if you struggle with finding that a counselor could be that person for youother things you could try include finding ways to calm your mind and body  theres a lot of apps available with calming scenes and soundscapes such as calm and headspace  st johns wart is also pretty popular for working with the symptoms of anxiety and depression and is available without a prescriptionjust as a last noteyou dont need your family to believe what you are going through to get better  it could for sure make it harder but if you can get through severe anxiety you can totally get through the healing process
674,can anxiety make me say foul language,im scared that my anxiety will make me say foul language i dont want to say those words though im only a teen and all my friends curse but i dont want to i dont know what to do,anxiety,its definitely possible that your response to anxiety is to swear though you dont have to feel controlled by that reaction  as a teen youre developing your identity based on what feels right to you and what doesnt  its ok to be different than your friends and just being around swearing doesnt mean you will for sure pick up that habit  what is it that connects your anxiety to swearing  if it feels like your automatic response might be to curse you could try picking some words that dont go against your values to use as a default when you are upset  you could also work directly with calming your anxiety maybe in ways that make you feel in control  breathing exercises as well as thought replacement replacing an unhelpful thought with a helpful one are good for that  whatever you try i wish you the best of luck
675,can anxiety make me think i heard something about me,when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,anxiety,sure can  especially social anxiety or anxiety in the form of paranoia  are there any patterns to when or where this happens most  does it ever happen with people you feel safe and comfortable with  or only when you are in an uncomfortable social setting  if you notice any patterns you can focus in on the anxiety surrounding them and build coping skills to help you get through those moments if thats what would feel helpfulyou could also seek help and talk to someone about whats happening to get a better assessment of your situation and more personalized techniques  theres many counselors out there that are great at working with anxiety
676,can anxiety make me think i heard something about me,when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,anxiety,anxiety can absolutely make you think you heard something about you when we are on high alert we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature  to some extent this is normal for example when people experience late onset deafness they often will worry people are talking about them and usually not good things because our brains tend to jump to that of course im not saying you are going deaf or anything just giving an example counseling can help you work through this anxiety it may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety which is a very distressing experience but both are absolutely treatable wishing you the best
677,can anxiety make me think i heard something about me,when im around people i sometimes think someone has made a comment to me or asked me to do something i will be focusing on something else and then randomly think i hear something about me i never know if it was actually said,anxiety,it sounds like you are having difficulty knowing if people are saying things to you or if you only thought someone was talking to you and this is anxiety producing its understandable that it could be confusing andor a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not its hard to say exactly what is going on from just this description but if you can work with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what is happening get clarity about your social interactions and develop some ways to deal with the anxiety
678,why do i always feel anxious,its especially bad at night time i am scared of sleeping alone,anxiety,night is hard for a lot of people so you are definitely not alone here  has anything scary ever happened to you at night  answering that question may give you the why of where thats coming from  if you havent had a bad experience at night it may just be the time when you have nothing to do which allows more intense thoughts and feelings to surface  heres a couple things to tryone thing you could do is sit down a couple hours before you go to bed and journal if you can  try to reduce any distractions and just go for it  the purpose of this is to slow down well before you go to bed expressing some of the anxiety from the day  also take note of the things you can tackle that day vs what can wait until later  this gives your brain a chance to sort through some of the planning type of anxiety that commonly comes up when you are trying to sleepanother thing you can do is make a list of the things you have control over  anxiety is really good at putting everything you feel out of control of on a giant metaphorical projection screen  try projecting some of the things you have control over instead  for exampleyou have total control over breathing patterns what you choose to wear the next day what you pay attention to if you go for a walk etc  you also have control over how you personalize that list to what matters to you  mindfulness is a great way to focus on how you control your breath and also how letting go of breathing doesnt stop your body from doing what its always doing to keep you alive  any google search will bring up lots of information on thissomething to remember is that experiencing anxiety is ok  it doesnt mean something is necessarily wrong  anxiety is sometimes just a feeling that comes up without much of a cause  if you cant identify that cause its probably because of a little misinterpretation in the brain  mindfulness can definitely help with that
679,why do i always feel anxious,its especially bad at night time i am scared of sleeping alone,anxiety,being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it is the first step to addressing and handling itgenerally anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life  somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very youngusually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonabletheir inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young hasnt faced the reality that the grown person is now capable even if this takes some practice try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown personalso sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely  this loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address
680,why do i see and hear things that are not real,im a teenager i am almost always paranoid recently i started to think they watch i keep seeing in the corner of my eye someone moving the other night i heard breathing in my room and my eyes focused on a black shape i turned on the lights but no one was there,anxiety,ive worked with teens in a day treatment program for about  years now and its been a theme that a lot of them see dark figures out of the corner of their eyes  pretty common with teens that have endured traumaphysical or sexual abuse witnessing domestic violence etc  we dont have a lot of information on why this happens but its theorized that the brain projects the emotions outside of us in the form of dark figuresmaybe just as a reflection of what is existing on the inside of the brain or even to give some emotional relief  when we have kids that have experienced those types of hallucinations they almost always disappear once they have worked through their trauma  sometimes visual and auditory hallucinations are symptoms of mental health disorders as well though thats pretty rare for those to start as early as the teens years  its best to have your symptoms checked out by a medical professional and maybe even a psychiatrist to get a better idea of what may be happening   are you or have you been taking any medications that could potentially have these side effects  if you do visit one or both professionals make sure you or a caregiver is giving them all the details about your symptoms so they can help you as much as possiblea big question here is what is your sleep like  lack of sleep is notorious for causing hallucinations and can become severe after only a few nights of sleep deprivation  if you are having trouble sleeping that may be another topic to discuss with your doctorno matter what it is its obviously scary otherwise you wouldnt feel paranoid  try some techniques to calm yourself a few times during the day like deep breathing or movementbased strategies like yoga  whatever speaks to you  and remember that while you are figuring this issue out the hallucinations cant hurt you even if they get strongerglad you are reaching out to get some help

682,i keep on changing my life when things get tough,ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,anxiety,is there a certain problem you feel about living the way you describeas long as you feel satisfied with how your life is unfolding then youre making wise decisionsif you feel tension or that somehow doing as you describe is wrong then the first step is to identify the way you feel your methodology described above has a role in working against your best interestbasically define what is problematic in order to address it
683,i keep on changing my life when things get tough,ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,anxiety,theres a quote i love that says wherever you go there you are and the book by the same name by jon kabatzinn may be very helpful for you the thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often arent the things that need changing the awesome and challenging thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be through this deeper work you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself if you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist id recommend looking for someone offering acceptance and commitment therapy act or mindfulnessbased cognitive behavioral therapy mcbt also helpful may be the online program of mindfulness based stress reduction msbr found here there are inperson programs across the country but this online selfguided version is free and a great resource
684,i keep on changing my life when things get tough,ive been like this ever since i was in school back then i transferred to another school now im thinking about changing my job,anxiety,its great that you are at least aware of what pushes you to seek change in your lifeif you were in session with me one of the first things id explore is what tough means for you  is it relationship issues with other people  or tasks related to your job  or is it something else  its important to know what you may be trying to escape in order to work with it  for example if you tend to make changes when you are faced with a commitment then there would be something about commitment that scared you and the work would be focused there  one thing to think about is that most people tend to run from things that they believe they cant handle or get through  could this be happening in your situation  if it is there could be some underlying fears present that you are incompetent or you will fail  whats interesting about that is that some people avoid change for the very same reasons  its actually quite amazing that you handle so much change in your life and have for a very long time  that shows you can handle a lot  the last thought i have is that the more you push through the tough stuff the more you will have confidence in your ability to do that  you dont have to feel confident to start the processin fact many people feel very vulnerable and terrified sticking with decisions that are out of their comfort zone  having social support even if its just one person is so important when youre facing your fears  that could mean counseling or a partner friend family member etc  doing it alone is another level of toughyou may be at the point in your life where you are just seeking some answers and arent feeling ready to address whats happening and thats ok  no one wants to go blindly into this kind of work  theres no rush to figure it all out right now  give yourself some time to let things unfold

688,how can i wake up without having an anxiety attack,i have these dreams of men and they always seem to try to hurt me its gotten so bad that i first wake at  then  and finally stay awake by  im always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake i hate falling asleep the longest ive went without sleep is three days,anxiety,no wonder you are scared to sleep if this is what you are going throughmy first thought is that its possible your dreams are your brains way of trying to process something that scares you or has scared you  theres not a lot of research on the purpose of dreams but one theory is that stuff you dont want to deal with consciously is able to come through via your unconscious brain as a dream or nightmare  another theory is more of gestalt nature where all your dream figures represent a part of youfor example the part of you being attacked would be the side of you that feels weak whereas the attacker is the side of you that you feel is bad or evil  either way your reactions are definitely legit because nightmares tend to flood the brain in a pretty emotionally raw formi am also curious if you had trouble sleeping before you started having these dreams is it because of these nightmares that sleep is an issue or have the sleep issues been a part of your life longer than the dreams  it may not mean a whole lot no matter what order they came in but it would be interesting to know if the catalyst was actually the dreams to begin with  the big question here is if not having these nightmares would improve your sleep and lessen your anxiety about sleeping overallas for the anxiety attacks theres a lot here you can try  your brain is seeing sleep nightmares or both as a threat  the way to signal safety to your brain is to practice some relaxation techniquesmindful breathing can be helpful or if you find it hard to sit still you can do some walking mindfulness  maybe youve heard of the calm appits so great for sleep issues  they have sleep stories and soundscapes as well as guided breathing exercises  this is speaking more to the thinking process but remind yourself that the dreams arent real and they cant hurt you  that doesnt mean you wont have anxiety and you have to fully believe it it just means that you dont have to get caught up in the fear response  you also mention that they try to hurt you  have you ever done things to fight them off or do you run  its ok if your response is to freezeim just curious how you view yourself in that dream  if you are feeling powerless which would be normal it may be worth your time to imagine how you want to fight them off  what weapons would you choose  what would escape look like  imagining you in charge may help change your experience of the dreamsalso remember that even though panic attacks feel awful they wont hurt you  its a really terrifying feeling to be trapped in your body during an attack but the response is meant to get us out of danger even though there is no real threat  if you do a google search for panic attack help sites theres so many that detail more of this response and how to move through an attack  of course seeing a counselor might be beneficial if you are sensing that theres something bigger underlying the dreams  sometimes just having someone listen and understand can ease some sufferingi hope that helps and you find something that works for you

691,why do i have panic attacks when i carry my baby,,anxiety,has something scary ever happened when you were carrying your baby before you had panic attacks  could have to do with fear of incompetence as a parent but may be something unrelatedfor example if you got some really bad news when you were carrying your child your brain may pair those two events together  or could it be that the feeling of pressure on your body sets off an anxiety response for you  do you have panic attacks when holding your baby sitting down or is it just when you are standingwalking  paying attention to when exactly its hitting you could give some clues about what is triggering that responseanother thing im wondering is if your baby either cries when you are carrying himher or if you carry himher mostly in response to the baby crying  im not sure if you are mom or dad here but women especially have a very physical response to babies crying  you can physically see this if you are breastfeeding because it triggers the lactation process  but it also can trigger some pretty hefty anxiety  the reason for this makes senseif we felt nothing when our babies started to cry we wouldnt be very motivated to attend to them to meet their needs  if baby is crying when you are holding himher it might be triggering that anxiety response and feel a lot of pressure to respond to your babys needs  if that turns into a pattern your body basically expects to feel that way and may respond habitually with panic even in the absence of baby cryingif you dont think its related to your baby being upset you could still be experiencing that habitual response of panic and especially if you are worried about having a panic attack which ironically can induce panic  a counselor may be able to help you untangle whats happening to you and some ways to work through that  it can be really scary to sit through a panic attack though there are so many techniques to help  people have written some really great articles on getting through an attack and there are other resources you can use like apps calm headspace panicshield etc and youtube has really great videos as welli also want to mention that if you avoid carrying your baby because of anxiety that would be a normal response  many people who have panic attacks tend to feel guilty about the things that they end up unable to do because of the anxiety they feel  remember you are doing the best you can  you are reaching out you are concerned  guilt about how you deal with anxiety really complicates your experience further so try to practice some selfcompassion if you are going through this  kristin neff has some great resources for that if you are interested httpsselfcompassionorgi hope all the best for you

693,how can i deal with this anxiety that keeps me up all night,ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week i cant sleep i get a sense of doom and its hard to breathe i feel like nothing i do makes it better,anxiety,that really sucks to go through  there are tons of ways to work with anxiety both directly and indirectly that can help with what you are dealing withdo you think you may be experiencing a panic attack  sounds like you are feeling some dread about what will happen to you and physical symptoms common with attacks  panic attacks are the bodys way of trying to alert you to danger whether that is real or perceived  its not something your body does against you but instead to keep you safe by keeping you in a state where you could react quickly run fight etc  this can happen even if there arent any real threats and you logically know you are safe  even if you arent having panic attacks that heightened anxiety can still feel really awful and exhaustingwhat have you done so far that is not working  when the brain is in that danger mode talking it down tends to be unsuccessfulthis is very evident in bounds of research we have on how the brain functions  the part of the brain that senses threats and triggers anxiety responses reacts more effectively to body signals to relaxsuch as controlled breathing  mindfulness breathing techniques have a lot of value for this reason and there are many options available apps like calm and headspace youtube guided videos etc  try to keep in mind that having anxiety doesnt mean that you are actually in any danger and mindfulness is not meant to be an escape  it does help to regulate and make you feel more in control of your body  your anxiety will always come back downyou can even track it to see the realtime changes that happen  its normal for it to rise and fall a few times during a panic attack so if you notice a rise it has no meaning other than that youre body is normally going through its anxiety responsei think seeing a doctor is a great idea to rule out any other issues happening within the body  some medical issues can materialize as anxiety and depression  depending on your symptoms they may even suggest a medication developed for these issuesanxiety is one of the top researched symptoms so we do have tons of research available on what works and whats less effective  we know that talking alone doesnt reduce the bodys fear response unless talking is the method of exposure talking about a traumatic experience talking within a group if you have social anxiety etc  for the brain to learn you are safe it takes experience via exposure while riding the wave of anxiety  for example if you fear vomiting you would expose yourself to things that remind you of vomiting and breathe through the anxiety you feel without avoiding the triggers  that would teach your brain that those triggers are actually benign and would no longer  create that panicky response itd be difficult to say what that may look like for you or even if you need that but it could be worth connecting with a counselor even online to discuss these options  the brain is always flexible to some degree to change so hang in there while you figure it all out
694,how can i deal with this anxiety that keeps me up all night,ive been having horrible anxiety for the last week i cant sleep i get a sense of doom and its hard to breathe i feel like nothing i do makes it better,anxiety,anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset attach themselvestry to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful peopleanxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long agoonce you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease  this is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others

703,how can i get over my fear of public embarrassment,a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,anxiety,hello and thank you for your question first i want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue everyone at some point in time has a fear of public embarrassment but for many people this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life  they will try to avoid any situation that they even think will cause them embarrassment or anxiety escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness isolation and even despair by avoiding we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment there are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue you can do an internet search and i recommend reading the reviews of the book that is  great way to find out if others have found the book helpful another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear i would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety acceptance and commitment therapy is  a good choice for helping with anxiety but there are many others the truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever get over but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently a colleague may offer some other advice as well be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
704,how can i get over my fear of public embarrassment,a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,anxiety,when i talk with clients about social anxiety sometimes ill ask them what they would do if their anxiety was manageable  would you want to be more social  would that improve you quality of relationships in your life  these answers can clarify what you want your life to look like and how much socialization you are truly interested inits normal to have thoughts and fears about what others are thinking of us otherwise wed be pretty shameless in our behavior  even though we feel as though we are in the spotlight the truth is that most people are not focused on us  theres hundreds of thousands of stimuli the brain processes especially at a party and you are a very small percentage of that  think about it this wayif you are at a party with a bunch of other people why would you be in center stage vs anyone else at that party  when people are worried about embarrassment or judgment they typically act in ways to be less visible in public  chances are people notice you less than they notice others simply because of avoidance behaviorsi dont think its needed to attend every social event because who has the energy for that  but pushing yourself to engage can teach your brain that you can push yourself through these events  the more you avoid the more your brain will because the situation is something to fear  if you can stick with someone you trust or connect to  that could help you to enjoy the experience more and frame it somewhat positivelyif you really struggle on your own you could visit a counselor and work on some strategies that fit for you
705,how can i get over my fear of public embarrassment,a lot of times i avoid situations where i am to meet new people because i have a fear of embarrassing myself i often avoid large groups of people like parties because i think they all constantly judge me,anxiety,why not accept and tolerate that you naturally are a shy person who doesnt like large groupsthis is not necessarily something to get over if it is part of who you arepeople have the capacity to judge others regardless of whether the group is large or smallif you arent afraid of being judged in small groups then study the factors which allow you to feel safe in small groups possibly you can generalize your findings to large group venuesif you try the and arent successful then likely you simply arent naturally someone who cares for large group settingsnot everything a person doesnt like is a symptom of something is wrong w the person
706,how can i talk to my psychologist about upping my dose of xanax,ive been on  mg of xanax twice a day for the past month it hasnt been helping me at all but when i take  mg during a big anxiety attack it calms me down i was wondering how i can ask my psychologist to up the dose to  mg twice a day without her thinking im abusing them i just have very big anxiety attacks should i stay on the mg and deal with the attacks or should i ask to up the dose im afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else,anxiety,it seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and thats so important in mental health you know best what is working for you and what isnt so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you i have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy and i work with many people that take xanax  counselors may not prescribe but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy theres definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world but many people are prescribed xanax to cope with big emotional responses  we dont know much about your situation hereif you are in counseling what types of other coping skills youve tried to use etc so itd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms  you are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do  and the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing  thats seriously so courageousa little bit about xanaxxanax is a drug in the benzodiazepine family and is fastacting  that means it does only help shortterm but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly just as people build tolerance to alcohol  that could be why they arent as effective for you at the dosage you are taking especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day  its really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage  these providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have the better they can meet your needs  they are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not xanax is the best for you and your situationi definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks  thats a scary thought  prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages  i have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage  not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it but give you a voice in your treatment  you may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the futurei do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of xanax  benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system cns to do things like slow down your heart rate breathing etc as you can feel when they do work  they should never be taken with any other depressants such as alcohol barbiturates and other medications in the benzo family  combinations like these could be fatalanother danger is that theres a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing xanax  this means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug  the reason for this is because when you are taking xanax your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug  so when you discontinue it your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels  your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that andor the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for youif you are in counseling and doing exposure activities being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response xanax does interfere with this process  the brain cant learn a different response if you feel calm  this is something your counselor if you have one can discuss with you as wellthe last thing id like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more longterm changes  that decision is completely yours  ifwhen you feel ready to do that a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on xanax  i hope this is helpful and you find what you need

711,how is it that i fear going to sleep,i just about fall asleep then i cant help but sit up and walk around,anxiety,this is very common  sleep is when we are most vulnerable and it requires our bodies to let go of control and lose awareness of a lot of our environment  has anything bad ever happened to you at night or when you were sleeping this could be something to consider  your body may be feeling a need to protect you by not letting you relax and instead keeping you awake and aware to anything around youcould you be worrying about what is happening the following day  its also normal to have pressures of the next day rolling through our minds before our bodies commit to sleep  if you pay attention to what you are thinking about before bed that could tell you a lot about what you worry about in your lifenot everyone is into meditation or mindfulness but these methods can help send the message to your brain that you are safe  there are some pretty neat apps like calm and headspace or mindfulness videos on youtube that have a variety of tools to fit what you may need  it may take a while for these to really start to show results so keep at it if you have the chancejournaling can also be a great way to release some of the stress from the day and silence the mind a bit  consulting with a doctor may also be a plus if your sleep continues to be impacted  not having proper sleep can lead to more anxiety and reduce the bodys capabilities to regulate emotion leading to worsened sleep  sometimes having a buffer there can help get your sleep on a better track while you work on the anxiety  hope you find some of this helpful
712,how is it that i fear going to sleep,i just about fall asleep then i cant help but sit up and walk around,anxiety,maybe you are afraid to let go of your problems for a few hoursalthough you didnt write this usually what keeps people awake or prevents them from falling asleep are worries about certain situations in their livesif this describes you then maybe talk with yourself to convince you that you are entitled to a good nights sleepreally we all are and feeling rested from the day and lifes tensions will better you to handle whatever the particular matters arealso maybe you will be more enthusiastic to go to bed if you have a comfy mattress and nice pillows  make your bed an inviting place because this will tempt you to enjoy relaxing enough to go to sleep
713,how do i handle my extreme paranoia,im just an extremely paranoid person i constantly feel as though i am in some sort of danger like as though i live in a horror movie with no resolution it worsens at night it gets to the point im scared in my own home more so than anything i have no access to the help i need so im desperate,anxiety,that really sucks and im sorry thats happening to youim curious what kind of paranoia you are experiencinglike someone will hurt you  that something bad in general will happen  sometimes intrusive thoughts like paranoid thoughts are just thoughts  they dont mean you are actually in danger or that something bad will happen so pay attention to the meaning you apply to those thoughts  if youve been through something traumatic such as rape domestic violence or any situation like that it could provoke paranoia bigtime  your brain feels as if it has to be hypervigilant meaning it has to be extra attuned to everything around you to keep you safe  thats exhausting  if its worse at night that probably means you arent getting much sleepalso exhausting and contributes to heightened paranoia so it becomes a pretty vicious cycleits not shocking that its worse at night because night is generally a scarier time and sleeping is physically when we are in our most vulnerable state  it can help to take a look at how much of that paranoia is actually helping you to protect yourself vs how much is additional stress  a way to figure that out is to ask the question what behaviors are necessary to keep you safe  so if you lock your doors lock the windows shut the curtains have an escape plan if neededim not sure what your situation is is that the most you can do  beyond that are you performing other behaviors that may not be keeping you safe but exist to cope with the paranoia  for example if you are checking over and over to make sure the doors and windows are locked those behaviors are more like compulsionsrituals that help you feel safe by reducing anxiety even though they use a ton of energy to perform  response prevention can be helpful herethis method involves avoiding your usual response so that you can sit with the anxiety rather than escaping it through the behaviors  lets say your anxiety rises and you feel the need to check the door lock  you check the lock its for sure locked and your anxiety is reduced  at the same time the behavior of checking the lock is reinforced by feeling better so your brain decides if you want to feel better you need to check the lock  it becomes an exhausting habit that only temporarily makes you feel safe  however if you feel a bout of anxiety and sit through it without checking the lock your anxiety will go back down and your brain learns that you dont need to perform that behavior over and over  im so sad to hear you dont have access to help  there may be some counselors right now offering reducedrate or probono free sessions via telehealth due to covid so if you search around on google for your specific state you may find someone that can help you from your home  counselors usually reserve space on their schedules for people that cannot afford therapy or need a lesser rateyou are always welcome to come back to this forum and ask additional questions

715,why am i scared to touch a girl,i dont know if im normal im really scared to touch a girl im a young adult and a virgin my fiancée and i want to have sex soon and this might mess everything up because she wants a baby soon as well,anxiety,only going off of the information in your question it seems like you maybe have some performance anxiety and fear disappointing your fiance  fear can be tricky in the sense that it quite often masquerades as something that seems under our control  for example your fear of touching a girl may actually be a fear of being incompetently intimate or a bad fianceits easier to deal with those fears by avoiding touch because that gives you control and how else would you deal with those fears i wonder if your fiance can be of any help to you  its scary to admit fears to people close to us but they can also offer some of the best support if thats been something youve experienced with her in the pastit sounds like you are really hard on yourself as well  its normal to have anxiety about your first time having sexthats a really special milestone  maybe its worth looking into performance anxiety tips  that can help you feel more prepared without removing the spontaneity of intimacyif it feels like nothing is working for you you could see a counselor or sex therapist to explore more of that fear  its nothing to be ashamed about because it does happen to both men and women
716,why am i scared to touch a girl,i dont know if im normal im really scared to touch a girl im a young adult and a virgin my fiancée and i want to have sex soon and this might mess everything up because she wants a baby soon as well,anxiety,your question is a good onethe best way to decrease the fear would be to talk with your fiancee about it   eventually shell find out and better to talk about it when there is less pressure than to be in the midst of a situation which frightens youalso she may feel similar to you who knowsdiscussing a topic which relates directly to your relationship is a good way to increase emotional intimacy  and emotional intimacy has a lot to do with feeling at ease with physical intimacy
717,how can i be less stressed out,i shake and have panic attacks,anxiety,so glad you are reaching out  panic attacks are very frighteningfor some reason and i promise there is one your brain is sending off false alarms even though you are probably safe  this is called the fight or flight response and part of the bodys way of fighting off perceived threats including those that are not genuinely dangeroussome reasons people have panic attacks is if they are under too much emotional or physical stress any type of exhaustion or lack of sleep history of trauma unprocessed emotions etc  you dont have to know why you are having panic attacks to work with them but it can help to understand its origins and target them at the sourcesomething to know is that the presence of anxiety does not mean you are in any danger no matter how much your body is elevated  anxiety is just our bodys way of letting us know something is off though it often exaggerates the response because it doesnt always operate from a place of logic  triggers could be as small as a word smell time of day or really anything  triggers can also be physical sensations inside our bodies  though panic attacks are very scary and feel incredibly uncomfortable they will not kill youwhat message might your body be sending you via panic attacks  is there any area of your life you could step away from at all to give yourself some relief  if you pay attention to when panic attacks happen that could clue you into what is setting off that false alarmsome apps that are really great for relaxation and use breathing techniques are calm headspace panicshield etc  try some out and see which ones really fit for your needs  breathing is a great tool because you always have it right there with you and its something you can control when it feels like your body is out of control
718,how can i be less stressed out,i shake and have panic attacks,anxiety,one way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourselfthe insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic one way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life   when there are many activities or involvements to pay attention then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them  this may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed ina simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactionsto know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life
719,how can i be less stressed out,i shake and have panic attacks,anxiety,one of the first things i would suggest is to see if you can keep track of what is leading you to feel anxious if you shake all the time consider talking with your primary care physician sometimes that can be a hormonal imbalance or another chemical imbalance such as thyroidone of the most difficult things about anxiety is that having anxiety particularly panic attacks can lead to anxiety about having more panic attacks also remember that panic attacks are typically part of your brains protective response to what it considers to be some sort of threat you may have heard of the fight or flight response when you have an anxiety attack your body is preparing you to react to something that isnt actually a threat so its almost as if youre fight or flight response is overactive here is an image that may be helpful httppsychologytoolsfightorflightresponsehtmlthere are many different things you can do you can practice breathing mindfulness meditation or yoga techniques if you decide to try some breathing techniques try breathing in for a count of five holding for a count of five breathing out for a count of five and repeating five timesalso remember that it is easier to learn these techniques when youre not having a panic attack at that point it can be really difficult to use methods to not panic also remember that panic attacks typically last  to  minutes using techniques to slow your breathing or become focused on the room around you is probably most helpful when you first start to feel anxioushere are some other techniques that may help to decrease anxiety httppsychcentralcomlibwaystoreduceanxietyrighthererightnowas you figure out what is leading up to your anxiety also consider asking yourself what is making that certain issue a big concern for you another important question could be when you have felt that way before

725,why do i find pleasure in thinking about killing,i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,anxiety,let me point a couple things out to you  these thoughts obviously go against your core values otherwise they wouldnt upset you  having thoughts about killing people bugs you and thats a good sign  you are also concerned enough to reach out on this chat forum  that tells me you have put some time into worrying about these thoughts and what they meantheres absolutely nothing wrong with a thought  we all have extreme thoughts in life because our brains are built to wander  unless you are acting on these thoughts they are not dangerous  its important to note that having a thought doesnt mean you are that thought  its pretty easy to assume that our thoughts are who we are but that couldnt be less true  if we were our thoughts wed be so many different things at once itd be unimaginablesomething i wonder is if these thoughts feel intrusive to you  even if you enjoy them do they seem to show up without invitation  when a thought is intrusive in nature it can often make someone feel as if it is uncontrollable and holds more weight than less intrusive thoughts  it is also interesting that you mention finding pleasure in thinking about killing in the sense that its definitely giving you some psychological relief in the moment  from that i have two thoughts  could it mean you are trying to cope with something socially upsetting to you via these types of thoughts and  im wondering if there is any repressed anger in your life  you mention being a peaceful person  are you usually the peacemaker in your social world  do you feel as if people take advantage of you or that you dont have a voice  those situations can breed anger and resentment if you dont allow yourself to feel or express anger the brain will find a way to do it for you and its not weird or strange that it would want to send out thoughts that clearly get your attentionanother thing you could try is tracking when the thoughts come up  keeping a log can help shed light on what may be triggering them and what their purpose may seem to bewishing you all the best
726,why do i find pleasure in thinking about killing,i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,anxiety,maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware existssometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving waythis is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamicmost important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings including the ones which are uneasy such as killing to consider
727,why do i find pleasure in thinking about killing,i am a peaceful person but i often find myself having thoughts about killing people eventhough i like the thoughts at the time they make me cry why do i feel like this,anxiety,hello and thank you for your question clearly this is something that has you very concerned sometimes thoughts are just thoughts and they are pretty harmless many people have thoughts of killing someone but they would never actually do it they really dont even want to do it they are just having a thought other times thoughts are a sign of something more serious and we should receive help when they start to worry us i would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts it is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement now if you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality you should call for help immediately by help i mean  or a family member or friend you would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others again none of this is to judge but rather to encourage you to get the help youre seeking either way when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior seeking counseling is usually a good choice be well robin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc

734,how do i shake selfdoubt about sex,i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,anxiety,tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring as well as listen to your specific worries and fearsinitiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sexthis way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion  not a prelude to sexif you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined
735,how do i shake selfdoubt about sex,i get very nervous and anxiousscared before sex,anxiety,i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to i dont know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirablethere is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex performancerelated or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular personhaving sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability if your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itselfif this feels pretty structured it is initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationshipif this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships

756,how can i be less afraid of rape,why am i so afraid of it i dont understand,anxiety,your fear is somewhat reasonable  no one wants to be raped and i imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel likedo you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would likeif this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fearis it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped  one general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe  the more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar probably your fear will decreasethe other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physicallyin families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generationits possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own sufferingthe good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden

opinion trying to scare you from having sex 
and if so how old are you is it ok to have sex do you want to have
sex  it sounds like you want to make
your partner happy and that you are taking care of protecting yourself and
your partner but maybe you are forgetting to consider what do you really want  having sexual relations is a very personal decision
you and your partner have to consent  it
is also important to talk about the possible consequences and being responsible
for them as well  but sex should be something
that you enjoy not that you should be fearful of  a therapist can help you to process those
negative thoughts and feelings that may impair you from enjoying your sexual

embarazo no deseado y poder tener sexo otra vezestoy

peligroso inclusive cuando yo y mi pareja usamos dos métodos de protección  mi pareja no está contenta y simplemente
quiere más sexo y honestamente yo quiero darle lo que ella quiereme pregunto quién
te está diciendo que el sexo es peligroso 
esto es aviso medico o es alguien intentando asustarte para que no
tengas relaciones  y si es así que

consecuencias de tener relaciones como un embarazo y discutir sus opciones e
intenciones si eso ocurriera  ya que
han tenido comunicación al respecto el sexo debe ser algo que disfruten  no que temen 
un terapista te puede ayudar a procesar esos pensamientos negativos y
los sentimientos que te pudieran impedir disfrutar de tu vida sexual"

770,why is it so hard for me to talk publicly,i feel really uncomfortable when i have peoples attention it makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class can i get over this social anxiety,anxiety,since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result or fear of being judged negatively as though having failed some sort of test consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audiencemaybe for example if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would youd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audienceonce you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort it may feel more manageableyes social anxiety can change  you may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audienceand it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you
771,how do i stop my nightmares,i have been having a lot of nightmares where i am being killed in different ways i either wake up in a panic or just crying and sweating it has made me terrified of falling asleep and is now affecting my daily life too can i make the nightmares stop,anxiety,hello and thank you for your question sleep problems including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about are really common for people and so many people suffer from them here are a few things to consider or to try  have you changed or started taking any new medication lately medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams if you are taking a new medication talk to your provider about the nightmares this may be the cause  stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states the dreams may not make much sense but then again even good dreams dont always make much sense ask yourself do i have any new or renewed stressors in my life work school relationships health all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out if this is the case talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help  something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something we can begin to obsess about it my guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed this could increase your chances of having another bad dream try relaxation techniques before going to bed if you have youtube you can pull up guided meditation for sleep exercises to help you relax there are many different ones to choose from you may also want to try deep breathing there are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares if you google search nightmare rescripting or nightmare exposure you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams i hope these ideas help be well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
772,i am paranoid that my boyfriend hiding something from me,my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,anxiety,have you spoken to him about your fears perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure  also it is important to trust your intuition  perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned it may not be paranoia  it may be based in reality
773,i am paranoid that my boyfriend hiding something from me,my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year we go to different schools and we dont see each other that often i just feel very paranoid that theres someone else or that he could be hiding something from me,anxiety,paranoid is a mental disorder word  that is a strong word i think to use in this situation  honestly the bottom like is either you dont trust him for some reason or you are insecure with yourself  which is it  do some soul searching to help you figure which one it is   work on either discussing why you dont trust him and work on building that trust or why you feel you are not good enough and work on that
774,im scared because my boyfriend is interested in bdsm,im concerned about my boyfriend i suffer from anxiety but i always have this feeling he wants to hurt me because he told me he was interested in bdsm intercourse we havent tried it but ive had this feeling he always wants to,anxiety,"hello thank you for your question there are few things
that people find more personal than their sexual relationships when we feel
connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread however if
we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful 
i dont know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea the only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way if you
believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe it sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority 
assuming you are able to share with him your feelings
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties all parties should feel respected and able to say no to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with 
i call the respectful agreement between sexual partners sex
trust sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries it means they
wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having  your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important 
now if there is a part of you that is curious about bdsm
and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information i will warn you some websites and articles
are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed 
many people engage in bdsm and have happy relationships but
again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants it is
also important to know that bdsm is not just one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort if it is something you are uncomfortable with
then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it
 
i hope this was helpful be well

775,what do i do when i have anxiety attacks,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,this is a very common question in my practice panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue ex depression low selfesteem fears to decrease your anxiety symptoms its recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable within my practice i educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety starting a daily mindfulness practice for example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities understand your negative and positive thoughts many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious for example i dont need to worry i am calm and relaxed  exposure to fearful or anxious situations this can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure this may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease i hope this was helpful keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement
776,what do i do when i have anxiety attacks,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,the other two post answers to your question are very good and i dont feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but i will offer one other option i have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks  chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events links that lead up to the behavior  in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were  see the illustration belowthis is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior panic attack allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations prompting events and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur consequences  finally  it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities such as not enough sleep poor nutrition trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred  working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as dbt or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events
777,what do i do when i have anxiety attacks,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,anxiety is simply your system communicating to you that you are in danger the issue that i see in most of my clients is that they try to reason with this anxiety you do not reason with sensory states in the body if your system tells your in danger your stomache feels like it is knots your heart is beating out of your chest validate by just being present with it take your breath to it breath in and out of that space say ok i am in danger i always tell my clients a crying baby wants to be held not told to shut up listen to your system validate it like you do a child and see what happens
778,what do i do when i have anxiety attacks,i get so much anxiety and i dont know why i feel like i cant do anything by myself because im scared of the outcomes,anxiety,the are two ways that such anxiety can be dealt with one is an attempt to replace maladaptive thinking by examining the distorted thinking and resetting the fightorflight response with more reasonable accurate ones as an example im scared of spiders but if you change the thinking from being scared to im bigger than the spider it allows the mind to reach a calmer state of mind mindfulnessbased therapy can also help  focus on the bodily sensations that arise when you feel anxious instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally truealthough it may seem counterintuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts you can practice responding to disruptive thoughts and letting these thoughts goby remaining present in the body youll learn that the anxiety being experienced is merely a reaction to perceived threats by positively responding to threatening events instead of being reactive you can overcome an erroneous fightorflight response
779,how can i avoid becoming wrapped up in family issues and control my anxiety about them,i started dating my fiancé two years ago my first cousin is married to my fiancés sister there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife my uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin and it upsets my mom,anxiety,based on the information provided this is an issue with boundaries   sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you  i do not like to assume so i will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation  enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships  triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other  from someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure  you may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries  although it is possible it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time  hope this help
780,how can i avoid becoming wrapped up in family issues and control my anxiety about them,i started dating my fiancé two years ago my first cousin is married to my fiancés sister there has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife my uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin and it upsets my mom,anxiety,when youre upset about something the first question you can ask yourself is whose problem is this it is amazing how many problems will disappear right at that point because you realize the problem isnt even yours you cant fix everything in your family you are starting a new family of your own and its time to create a protective bubble around your family unit that keeps other peoples issues away i tell myself not my pig not my farm not my problem when you stop trying to take care of other peoples problems they are more likely to step up and deal with it themselves 
781,why am i so anxious in social situations,whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,anxiety,"basically your response is the fight flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically the autonomic nervous system called the autonomic response  this system
is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe  it is largely an unconscious function but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations  one of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the nasa program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the
challenge with success  you can learn
more about his by going to ted talks what i learned about going blind in space it is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it 
with that being said finding a program
like a dale carnegie public speaking program can help  working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well good luck"
782,why am i so anxious in social situations,whenever i have to speak in public or be in big crowds i freak out i get lightheaded sweaty and i have trouble breathing,anxiety,as you do it more it should get better or at less with less anxiety  anxiety is normal for most when speaking in public  i hear this from even the best of facilitators who have been doing it for years  i even experienced that when i first became a counselor and had to lead classes  i asked myself why were i so anxious  i admit at that time i didnt have confidence in myself  the more i prepared and practiced the more my confidence level increased  yours will too
783,ive been having the same dream since i was a child,i am a teenage girl ive been seeing the same dream once in a while since i was very young the problem is that i dont remember anything about this dream i still know that its the same one and then i wake up in a panic and i cry really loud without knowing the reason why do i see the same dream why can i not remember it and what should i do to remember it,anxiety,there is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that i know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves one thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up people seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember
784,if im not with my boyfriend i have emotional breakdowns,ive been with my boyfriend for a year and a half he loves me a lot and i love him it hurts to be apart from him for so long it hurts all over and then i feel like it wont last,anxiety,i would suggest that you look up the word codependency and its characteristics  see if you relate to those characteristics  i have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly  for some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss  considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues
785,why am i all of a sudden having issues communicating with the guy im dating,i started seeing this guy that i met at a mutual friends place he recently broke up with his exgirlfriend and started seeing me everything was great in the beginning then i started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his exgirlfriend again its all i think about i am still seeing him but things have changed because i am at a loss for words i get stuck in my own thoughts i like and care for him a lot he just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies,anxiety,sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts  as you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  what is contributing to these negative thoughts  his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question
786,how can i get over social anxiety,i have not had a friend since i was  i dont go anywhere and i have no job all because im afraid of people,anxiety,individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want in group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another

788,am i somehow stressing myself out,i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,anxiety,where you put your attention is where you will go i forget who said this first but its very powerful if all you think about and talk about is how annoying you think you might be that will get annoying your intense self reflection is lovely it will help you monitor yourself so that youre not affecting others negatively but your alarm is going off too easily here and you risk having the opposite effectyou dont have to be perfect shes with you so she probably likes you as you are she seems to put far less emphasis on your possibly annoying traits we all have faults and if thats what we focus on thats all we will see my hunch is that your most annoying trait might be your negative selftalk how ironic is thattheres another irony hereyour goal is to be a better partnerbut when you are selfcritical your focus is on you not her every moment that fear grabs ahold of you is a moment that youre not being present in the actual relationship youre gazing at your imagined faults fear steals your ability to focus on your loving partner maybe take a moment to image how she sees youall of you put yourself in her shoes to see the entire youhow are you lovingthoughtfula good partner confidence is a very attractive quality
789,am i somehow stressing myself out,i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,anxiety,im glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like youtrust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourselfis the friend who says youre just fine very familiar with who you arefriend is a broad categoryshe may not know you as fully as you know yourselfbasically it is possible to be fine and have some inner stressfollow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware
790,am i somehow stressing myself out,i think im annoying and bothersome but my girlfriend says im just fine i dont think so i think im stressing everyone else out,anxiety,interesting  how much of your issue is your own selfjudging and how much of your perception is realthere are many ways to stop judging and selfjudging using cognitive theory cbt  you could find a cbt counselor therapist to help you reduce your judgments  in addition ive written extensively about this in my book living yes a handbook for being human wwwlivingyesorg  i recommend you visit the webpage and pick up a copyas to your own perception  you seem okay being who you are and your girlfriend agrees  instead you appear to be upset by your own guess at what others may be thinking thats a trap that stresses a lot of folks out  consider this  many happy people dont mind what others think of them  and consider this  many heroic characters in literature and movies are unlikeable  colombo is annoying and bothersome but we love him  so is johnnys depps jack sparrow and many of the roles played by george clooney sandra bullock and jack nicholson  would it be okay with you to be an antihero in your own life  if you dont want to be an antihero you have the power to be the person you want  your behaviors and thoughts are completely under your control  what other people think of you is not under your control  you are completely in the drivers seat here  the choices are all yours  enjoy who you are and use your will power to make yourself who you want to be  mark  wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg
791,how can i deal with my paranoia,im a little paranoid my mind does get the best of me one night i put chairs under all of my door knobs because i thought someone might break in i also think a lot which is probably the reason for the paranoia i cant stand loud noises like the sound of cars going by the grocery store is too noisy and i feel like people are looking at me,anxiety,paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid  they believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threatsfrom what you write you are aware that your actions may be understood as extremeinstead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category try seeing each of the behaviors you list here as your own uniquenessthis way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendenciesif you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid it is simply the way of who you areone possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself  they may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream  from what you describe you already are dealing with what you call paranoia
792,do i have social anxiety,when i go to school i feel like everyone is judging me even my friends i get overwhelmed which these thoughts and sometimes cannot get out of what i call a deep hole of thoughts i barely go to any of our school dances because of all of the people not even when i am completely alone do these thoughts go away i still feel like people can see me and are judging me,anxiety,it sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged even when alone it sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like such as leading them to isolate in therapy you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationships
793,how do i get over my fears of dying,recently i had a close call after delivering my second child blood clot followed by internal bleeding and several blood transfusions it was a close call i am currently undergoing medical treatment because of the event and i am constantly afraid the whole ordeal will happen again i have never really had anxiety in the past but i find now that it consumes my every day and night with two beautiful children to raise i am most terrified of not being able to raise and protect them,anxiety,hi meriden its natural that after a serious scare like that you would have some anxiety and fear this fear is helpful to some extent because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health you can say thanks very much to fear for trying to protect you and then you can take steps to reduce it right now fear is working overtime and stealing your quality of life you can work to put it into perspectivei invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you dont need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be imagine that fear is in front of you its saying hey you need me if i wasnt keeping you alert you would be very ill fear doesnt trust you to take care of yourself what is the evidence you are caring for yourself and doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence what is the evidence that this wont likely happen again it was specifically connected to the stress of labour right what is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur what is the evidence that you are healing what is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence what is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you not help you how many hours of your life do you want to hand over to fearfear is trying to keep you safe but you can turn the volume down by talking to yourself about all these things i wish you well
794,im worried that theres something wrong with the guy i love,i met a guy a while ago and i cant stop thinking about him i feel like i love him but i dont think i know him what if he is not who i think he is i cry sometimes thinking someone is going to be with him or that he has a girlfriend i dont know am i too obsessive every time we talk though its like magic he makes me feel amazing but what if im mistaken,anxiety,keller it sounds like youre living this relationship in your mind instead of in the real world you can get answers to your questions by talking to himgetting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have youre asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship so what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him fear of rejection fear of something else if you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships i recommend a therapist to help you work through that i wish you well 
795,why am i not as comfortable around my boyfriend anymore,ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,anxiety,how is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around himhas he told you that hes noticed changes in youthe good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person  doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship  given that the two of you recently moved in together it is natural for new dynamics feelings and expectations to arise  it just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of youpsychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills  very often just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually areanxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressedit is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters   be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you   youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations  keep the label of being disordered aside  psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives
796,why am i not as comfortable around my boyfriend anymore,ive been experiencing a lot of anxiety and panic attacks lately i was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with obsessivecompulsive disorder lately ive been questioning everything from my career to my relationship my boyfriend and i just moved in a few months ago all of a sudden i dont feel as comfortable around him as i used to although i cant seem to find a reason as to why i feel this way,anxiety,hi new jerseyyou talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosisanxiety and the moving in together thats a loti love how you recognise that you been questioning everything i think anxietys got its toe in the door and its pushing you around wanting some power over you fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that its best to either pull away or fight but letting anxiety control how you see your relationship isnt the answer here i think you know that alreadyyou must have moved in with him for a reason and its appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriendwhen youre in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change i suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear

801,im worried that i will be single forever,"i have lately been having lots of anxiety and selfloathing about the fact that i am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before it seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore and i just had my first kiss five months ago im worried that at this rate i wont have a boyfriend for a very long time the problem is that i want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me but at the same time i dont want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex i have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them luckily they were nice guys but none of them wanted a relationship with me i feel dirty by doing this but i feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal
   most people are surprised when they find out that i am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think i am really good looking i am tall i play lots of sports and i get excellent grades in school i am in my first year of university right now and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest it bothers me most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already i feel like i will be single forever sometimes",anxiety,hi winters im so glad you wrote because i think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing you feel selfloathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what theyre supposed to be they feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually but you cant be both so you cant ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language this current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless the stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness  i urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings my hope and prayer is that they will echo my words hereyour value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated i love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares who you are is so very much more than your sexuality you sound like you have a lot of things going for you try to see all of those things when you think of yourselfthere are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they dont fit in we are all different and you dont have to be anything but who you want to be who you are you dont have to have any kind of sex until youre ready and that makes you brave and smart not weirdyoure tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that it may take time for you to meet the right guy but hes out there the question is how do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path i hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal i wish you the best

805,how do i become more confident and face social situations,for my whole life ive been very unconfident insecure and selfquestioning im super quiet because im scared of what people will think of me i avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety it is how both of my parents have always been and i feel like im doomed to that life also it makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because im too nice it causes me depression and brings me down im in my early twenties and i really need to create a better life for myself ive been like this for so long so how do i change,anxiety,one of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves  despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries  once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries  in effect assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem you may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation   one of the workbooks that i have found to be very helpful is the assertiveness workbook how to express your ideas and stand up for yourself at work and in relationships by randy j paterson

809,i have come to the realization that my boyfriend and i want different things,i feel that i need to end my present relationship he lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month i want someone who is more present and more of a life companion lately he has had a very busy work schedule and i have only seen him a few times in the last  weeks i told him that i cant continue in this way because i constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority i also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship i want we have been together  years the problem is that i panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking i will never meet someone i like we have gone through this cycle already  times and i feel it is unhealthy to stay in it but my aversion to the anxiety and depression i experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile,anxiety,it sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck it also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner are pretty overwhelming a competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you

813,i always feel the need to tell people everything,whenever i dont tell my friends or anyone what i did or stuff thats not really important i feel terrible like theres a hole in my stomach it only goes away when i hurt myself,anxiety,sorry to hear of your situationpossibly you are overlooking that your own self is someone worth talking to as wellnone of us are ever really alone because we are always with ourselvesselftalk is a major part of what guides our decisions and how we make sense of relationships and situations    even after telling people the stories or activities hearing their comments it is always within ourselves that we decide if the way we were received by these others the comments we heard back feel right and accurate to our livesi hope the feeling of a hole in your stomach would decrease by enjoying your self    i am guessing that hurting yourself makes the stomach hole feel less bad because the physical pain you create in yourself distracts you from feeling itenjoying your self by talking kindly loving and having inner dialogue may very well decrease the feeling of a hole altogethersending lots of good luck
814,could a rape that happened years ago be the cause of my anxiety,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxiety,while anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come this is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially this fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again however as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online
815,could a rape that happened years ago be the cause of my anxiety,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxiety,hi even though thankfully your parents responded well to you telling them and you received treatment its possible and very normal for sexual abuse trauma to affect you in different ways as you age and develop please see a therapist who can help you find the root of the anxiety
816,could a rape that happened years ago be the cause of my anxiety,i was raped repeatedly when i was younger i told my parents and action was taken but now that im an adult i suffer from extreme anxiety,anxiety,its not unusual for traumatic experiences that happened when we were younger to stay with us when we get older  traumatic experiences can become embedded in our bodies as well as in our emotions  if the issue doesnt get a chance to get resolved within then external action doesnt necessarily take care of the problem  seek out a qualified trauma therapist so you can start to deal with the issues youre grappling with
817,how do i become less anxious in conversations,i find myself being very outgoing most of the time but there are some times when i dont know what to say i dont even want to talk at all its like i search for the right thing to say and nothing ever comes out i dont know if im outgoing only to fill the void of not knowing what to say i dont know if people like that about me im very selfconscious and always think people are talking about me so it makes me have a cold shoulder and not want to talk,anxiety,would you feel more secure in conversations if instead of talking soon after meeting someone or entering a social situation you simply listened attentively to the other peoplethis way youd have a more secure idea of what topics the group likes talking about and whether you like talking about these topics as wellmaybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focusstart by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you aremaybe you simply need new and different groups
818,i am fearful of social situations and avoiding people all together,this is preventing me from getting a job i have bad relationship with my bipolar mother i am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that i have locked myself in my room i have no friends or other family to help me i have no money for therapy but i think i need therapy before i can secure a job,anxiety,overwhelming fear social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge  but there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this  so there is hope   in addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor who may prescribe a medication to help you relax there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid  a good cbt therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts  behavior is also important  despite how you may feel it is helpful to go out to do things that relax you maybe a yoga class or a meditation class  exercise diet eat well think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past and force yourself to do these things again  i know that this seems hard but it beats the alternative doesnt it  of course i recommend you pick up a copy of my book living yes which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out  i hope you get unstuck soon  mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg

851,i think my daughter is stressing too much,when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a  but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,parenting,its so tough to watch your children struggle and it seems like you care strongly about how she is feelingi think theres a lot of questions that come to mind when i read this question  what things upset her  how often do these things occur  what would it mean if it broke her  also is she a high school or college student still living at home or a college student living out of home  just with the information given its possible she has some perfectionistic tendencies  what this can mean is that there is a very clear intolerance for anything she sees as a failure whether or not it truly is  it can also mean that she neglects other important areas of her life in order to focus her attention on her academics  many people that deal with perfectionism often sacrifice social opportunities for work which can be really lonely and stressfulanother thing to consider is that it may have nothing to do with being perfect  if she is living out of the home is this her first time out on her own  thats a difficult change all in its own  if shes still at home is she nearing the age of graduation and feels the pressure of figuring out her lifecareer path  does she have other social issues going on with friends or is in an unhealthy relationship  no matter the answers to these questions you are the best judge of what your daughter may need  it could be worth having a conversation to understand her perspectives and assess her willingness to see a professional  and make sure you are taking care of yourself as well  its easy as a parent to become enmeshed with our childrens pain when they are hurting but taking care of yourself can best prepare you to help your child
852,i think my daughter is stressing too much,when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a  but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,parenting,sometimes it is hard to empathize with our children adults have had so much life experience and know how the world works  i think whatever is bothering her at the moment doesnt seem silly to her  what are her goals are they realistic  it sounds like your daughter might be a perfectionist is it necessary for everything to be perfect  no we all make mistakes  perfectionists tend to sabotage their own success and succeed despite their perfectionism  perfectionism makes them stressed and anxious and they have to deal with those feelings every day on top of striving for success  perfectionists also often have what is called a fixed mindset they believe their basic abilities such as intelligence and talents are fixed traits   they are set in stone  for them if they are not naturally good at something there is no hope of improvement  this mindset leads them to them want to appear perfect and never make mistakes  your daughter probably needs some help to change her fixed mindset to a  growth mindset  people who have growth mindsets believe their abilities can improve over time thinking this way helps become more motivated and resilient they believe they can find ways to fix mistakes and get better at the challenging things by getting help studying a different way  and not giving up a therapist who treats children her age could help her reframe her approach to challenging tasks and the way she thinks about her gifts and talents

855,i think my daughter is stressing too much,when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a  but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,parenting,i hear your concern that your daughter might break under the pressure and stress that she is dealing with  it is a good thing that your high achieving daughter is calling out for help and that you are listening  the education system is wrought with social and emotional problems and there is a disproportionate emphasis on test taking scores and achievement in school   it sounds like your daughter would benefit from some social and emotional education and learning to understand how her feelings are impacting her thoughts and behaviors  id like to also assure you that crying and freaking out is a normal part of growing up  depending on your daughters age it is likely that she is going through a growth spurt and she may be feeling her feelings in a unique way to her too  if this is the first time you are having a concern about anxiety then rest at ease and see if you can ride the emotions with her and be a stable sounding board for her   use empathy and compassion and allow her a safe place to process through her concerns  try not to solve it for her but allow her a space to fumble through and find her own answers to the problems she is faced with  give her confidence that she can figure it out and be patient as you sit with her  our presence is key to our childrens well being   make eye contact with her allow her to squirm and get frustrated and work through it while you witness her process  as parents when we can model calm in the storm of life our children learn that all of their feelings are ok too  when our children see and feel our fear it can create more insecurity and low self evaluation of their own efficacy to manage the stress  when we can be calm and reassuring then we can boost their confidence in their own ability to problem solve what they are going through  lets face it we all have irrational thinking from time to time and usually it is when we are under stress  if your daughter continues to show concerning anxiety check with her school and see if she can benefit from an opportunity with the social emotional learning curriculum  in texas at least schools are required to have resources for children like your daughter who are experiencing anxiety and other mental health concerns  her teacher is with her all day and you may request to have a conference with her to see if she can help her in any way as well  if resources in your school are limited then i would seek an outside therapist who specializes in working with children your daughters age  call around and see if she can benefit from a therapeutic relationship outside of school and home  once you have plenty of feedback from her teacher and a therapist or counselor then you will be able to determine if seeking medical care is necessary with their support and guidance  thank you for your courage to reach out for help on behalf of your daughter  you are her greatest advocate  i hope that you find support to help you navigate this time in her life and that you both grow and learn from this experience

867,i think my daughter is stressing too much,when my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school she starts crying and freaking out she is a bright student always has a  but i am afraid she is stressing too much im afraid its going to break her i dont know if i should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal,parenting,hello first of all thank you for paying attention to your daughter and noticing that she is concerned it sounds like you have been a positive influence on her for her to be so focused on achievement and for her to care so deeply about her performance based on what youve said here i understand that you are concerned that she is overly stressed though i share your concern people of all ages have meltdowns when they become overwhelmed with stress and the negative consequences of those meltdowns can definitely have a rippleeffect into other areas of our livesfor your daughter the thing i would want to know first is this does she feel she has adequate healthy coping skills to manage the stress she is experiencing because it doesnt really matter what she is stressing onwhat matters is how she deals with her stress when it threatens to overwhelm her id like to know what exactly that she does when she is feeling stressed that helps her to feel better if she has only unhealthy coping skills for example sleeping shuttingdown raging selfattack with critical selftalk etc or only one or two healthy skills we would want to teach her some additional healthy strategies to help her know that she can cope just one risk of not addressing this issue now could be that she may come to learn that stress is unbearable which may cause her to turn to destructive or escapist strategies to avoid the discomfort the pain of feeling hopeless andor the negative belief that she cannot help herself  i definitely think it would be worth both your whiles to have her evaluated by her family doctor andor a professional counselor with a counselor specifically she could learn the needed skills as well as be evaluated for other issues that may be contributing to the issue for example a learned belief that she must be perfect or she is not worthy plus having a neutral support person to help her meet her personal goals is always a good thing good luck mom and daughterlearn more about me and my practice at wwwemdrhealscom

883,is it ok ayto talk with my grown children about spending time with their children,i was a single mom most of their growing up life and have guilt about trying to work three jobs and being gone a lot my children are successful with their own businesss have lots of nanny and cleaning help but i just feel they have such a great opportunity to spend it with their kids,parenting,you seem to have been a very positive influence in your kids livesthey may have worked so hard because they understood how difficult and tiring your life was as a single momi feel you are seeing your kids lives through the measurement of how much toil was in your life as a single momin other words what you see your kids overlooking or not appreciating may remind you of your wishes during the many years you raised your kidsif it helps you and is possible then maybe you could spend more of your own time tougher with your grandkids  this may give some reward for the many years you spent working to support your kids and had no choice in the amount of time you had with your kidsas far as your kids relationship to their kids it is now their turn to raise them as they wish within ethical boundaries of coursedepending on the topics you and your kids talk about consider to bring up your concern as to whether they feel their kids your grandkids are missing anything due to the limited time they have with the parents
884,what can i do about my dad,my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless he calls me names and makes me feel depressed i want to move out because i swear if i stay here im going to lose it what can i do,parenting,you are valid  your idea about i want to move out may be the key to putting some distance between you two and giving you the space you deserve also taking the power away from him and giving it back to yourself  do not base your worth on others opinions often how other people act towards us is more about them than us  other peoples opinion of you does not decide the sum total of your worth you alone do thatthis meditation could prove helpful   i am enough  guided meditation
885,what can i do about my dad,my dad makes me feel like shit and like im worthless he calls me names and makes me feel depressed i want to move out because i swear if i stay here im going to lose it what can i do,parenting,if youre actually able to afford to move out and support your own life then this is a reasonable choiceif youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad then emotionally protect yourself from himdoing so is much more difficult than maybe it soundsdo you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a selfcreated safe space than around your dadalso limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you dont offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize youare there other people who live in the household w you and dadif yes then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by him what do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you namesis it possible the other family members dont realize how hurt and upset you are by your dads behaviorif yes then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dads name callingit is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stopnot necessarily that he will stop  knowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own

887,my fiancés exhusband shows up unannounced,he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids my fiancé tells me it makes her angry and doesnt like it but she seems afraid to say anything to him about it for some reason is it okay for him to do this,parenting,the short answer to your question is no its not okay for anyone to ever be doing this theres a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention nevertheless dont hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call     ideally your fiancé would be able to speak directly to her exhusband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements the fact that shes afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior and that she hasnt been able to give you any reason for her fear suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors entitlement andor codependence   i hope things work out well for all and im confident a skilled therapist could help all navigate how best to set boundaries and experience greater healing

890,my fiancés exhusband shows up unannounced,he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids my fiancé tells me it makes her angry and doesnt like it but she seems afraid to say anything to him about it for some reason is it okay for him to do this,parenting,the obvious answer is no its not okay  there are other you should be asking though  you said your fiance seems afraid of her ex  did you ask her about that  is there a reason he still has a key to the  home  has there been any discussion of appropriate boundaries  i work with a lot of people parenting from different households and the stickiest spots are the ones that have not been discussed  there is obviously conflict there or they wouldnt have split but your fiance and her ex do need to stay aligned for the kids and that cant happen if she feels fearful or resentful  if she doesnt have a problem with his barging in clearly you do and who wouldnt  hes not your ex so you and she need to have some agreements around his access to the home  if she is afraid to bring up the discussion then i strongly recommend that she and the ex get some help with a good therapist  the kids health your health and hers and the health of your relationships in the family depend on it

   i dont know how to communicate with her she is not open to any suggestions how do i get through to her",parenting,that sounds awful and is clearly unsustainable  there are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition  if all physical and mental health issues are ruled out its time to take action  get backup from friends or family members if you need to but let your daughter know you are giving her  days notice  she needs to find another place to live within that time  if she wants to stay with you be clear that first she has to go with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time  once out she can prove to you and more importantly to herself that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment  remember you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful if she is in good health her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her

   i dont know how to communicate with her she is not open to any suggestions how do i get through to her",parenting,this sounds like a painful situation where you care about your daughter and want to help yet you feel helpless to do so im sorry you are going through this you do not mention how old your daughter is which makes a huge difference in my mind as to how to approach this if she is a minor then you have a responsibility for her health and wellbeing if she is  or older this shifts a bit i would suggest slowing everything down and consider your goals if you continue to require her to behave differently every time you interact she will likely continue to tune you out however if you choose to prioritize your relationship and connection to her there are other approaches these include taking an interest in her as a person being willing to talk with her without making any suggestions and if possible withholding judgment about what she is doing or not doing this takes practice and tremendous control because of our tendency as parents to want to fix whats wrong best wishes

   i dont know how to communicate with her she is not open to any suggestions how do i get through to her",parenting, shes an adult she lives in your house she follows your rules what youre describing could be any number of things but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention thyroid issues autoimmune diseases  theres a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms im not a doctor this is a forum of therapists i recommend the book codependent no more which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter you may be inadvertently making things worse by helping her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors another book you may find helpful is boundaries where you end and i begin you cannot control another person especially an adult the only person you can control is yourself tough love is sometimes needed and she is an adult  treat her like one maybe then shell act like one if we were having this conversation in person you would interrupt me at this point with a but and then explain all the reasons why you cant tell her to move out get a job get up and cook or clean the house etc i already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are yes i said excuses instead of reasons because thats what they are you may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her but you have choices  you just may not like them i know that when children are small parents lives are focused around them some more than others and decisions are made around what is best for your child but you said your daughter is an adult the relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one i know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldnt want for them no matter what that choice may be as a parent we want to force them to do what we think is the right thing but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved whether the issue is a hair color a tattoo a lifestyle choice a job or choosing not to work or take care of their health or doing drugs or drinking  the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices
898,my son plays alone at recess,is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,parenting,it can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships parents can usually tell when their child is happy but kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn a parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone a parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play if a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own i encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully use phrases like hey i noticed something or let me help you be successful by showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zonewhen to seek professional help when does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues true personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood still professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities also parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety the vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal if the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company
899,my son plays alone at recess,is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,parenting,i recommend asking your son about the reasons he chooses to play alone at recess if he is happy on his own and you know he has some friends i would not be very concerned however there may be bullying going on at school in the case of bullying it may be a situation where you as his parent will need to step in
900,my son plays alone at recess,is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,parenting,my son plays alone at recessis this something i should be worried about should i do something about itevery mom is the expert on their childrens behavior  first of all i suggest checking with your son asking him if he is happy while playing alone or does he complain that no one wants to play with him  does he plays alone in school but is social in other environments with family or neighborsplaying alone is healthy for children it helps them to be independent and confident it allows them to explore their environment and use their imagination among other benefits  on the other hand it is also important to develop social skills early on and become confident in our skills as we grow  children go through stages of exploration until they develop a sense of social confidence depending on your sons age he might need some input or advice  provide the opportunity to interact with other children without pushing it  take him to the park to play with a friend or to childrens activities in your neighborhood  later ask him what did he thought of the activity and if he enjoyed playing there  children also follow their parents model so you can encourage social interaction by greeting other and asking your son to do the same ask him to receive the guests who come to the house with you and sit to enjoy the conversation if you notice any shakiness becoming tearful anxious or aggressive when approaching social encounters you may want to talk to the school counselor or childrens therapist to evaluate those symptoms and rule out any behavioral problems or social anxietymi hijo juega solo en el recesodebería preocuparme al respecto  debería hacer algo al respectocada mama es experta en la conducta de sus hijos  primero que nada te sugiero que revises con tu hijo y le preguntes si él se siente contento jugando solo o si se queja porque nadie quiere jugar con él   observa si él juega solo en la escuela pero es sociable en otros ambientes como con la familia  o los vecinos jugar solo puede ser saludable para los niños les ayudo a ser independientes desarrollan sentido de seguridad y les permite explorar su ambiente y utilizar su imaginación entre otros beneficiospor otro lado también es importante desarrollar destrezas sociales y perfeccionarlas con la práctica   los niños van por etapas de exploración y prueba hasta que desarrollan un nivel de confianza en sus destrezas sociales  dependiendo de la edad de tu hijo puede que el necesite algunos consejos  provéele la oportunidad de interactuar con otros niños sin obligarlo ya sea yendo al parque a jugar con vecinos o a actividades comunitarias infantiles con algún amigo  luego pregúntale como le pareció la actividad y si le gusto compartir allí  también recuerda que los niños siguen el modelo de sus padres así que puedes motivarlo invitándolo a que salude a otros después de ti o invitándolo a recibir a la visita que llega a la casa y que los acompañe durante la conversaciónsi observas que tu hijo está nervioso lloroso o agresivo cuando se acerca alguna actividad social consulta con el consejero escolar o un consejero infantil para evaluar sus síntomas y descarta cualquier problema de conducta o ansiedad
901,my son plays alone at recess,is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,parenting,humans are social creatures so this can be an alarming thing for a parent to deal with just like adults children are not the same and some children are more social than others if he plays alone at recess all the time it would worry myself as well however recess is only one domain of life does he have friends outside of school or daycare does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs if this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on if perhaps it is occurring just during recess it could be something else altogether i would request reports from all teachers and caregivers concerning socialization and make a choice on whether or not to evaluate furtherhope this helpsc
902,my son plays alone at recess,is this something i should be worried about should i do something about it,parenting,the answer depends on how the other areas of your sons life are doingis he happy or does he seem happy playing alone during recessdoes he have friends in other social circles besides the students whom hes with at recesshow is his academic progresshow is his social integration among his classmatesare there any special or unusual circumstances in the home and family environmentgo through this list to form a fuller idea of whether your son simply likes alone time and takes this option during recess or if any if the above areas show stress or difficulty for him and which need to be further understood and handled
903,my toddler wants her daddy to die when shes mad at him,i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,parenting,children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with childreni would also wonder where she is getting this idea sometimes children hear things on tv or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are rememberingit may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking forim curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry does she say the same sorts of things about youit may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well
904,my toddler wants her daddy to die when shes mad at him,i told her that if daddy dies we will never see him again she started crying because i wouldnt make her daddy die,parenting,its normal for a child to be so angry she wanted someone to die but this seems to be heading into a dangerous realm i think it would be wise to have her seen by a child psychologist just to rule out anything more serious

   my mother says that if i live under her roof i have to follow her rules she is trying to control my life what should i do",parenting,hi   im sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation  i have worked with a number of young adults in their s who have had to move back home after college  or even stay at home through the college years  bottom line is that either way  it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be  to have to live at home   i have even heard much older adults clients  say that when they visit their childhood home  they suddenly feel like a kid again   the old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults i would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like i am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here  i really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until i get on my feet  and i want to be respectful of you and our home  at the same time  though i feel like its important for me to have more independence than when i was younger because i am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can  both live with  if she is receptive  maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both    if this is too hard to do alone  perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come  up with some kind of compromise contract   this is not an easy situation  but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that doesnt take place in the heat of the moment  your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live withgood luck elissa gross

   i need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since i have nowhere else to go i feel very emotionally drained how can i deal with this",parenting,wow thats tough  its understandable to feel trapped when the people you depend on are mistreating you  while you cant change your parents fortunately you can work on changing yourself and your situationoften the clients i work with feel trapped when there are actually things they can do to change their situation  the problem is our emotions can be so powerful they can distort our perception of reality or prevent us from doing the things necessary to build a better life  work through this with a therapist to see if your emotions might be getting in the way and look outside the box for things that you can do to change your situation  in the meantime here are some other things you can work on  assume the best and try not to take it personally  most likely your parents dont want to cause you harm but they dont know any other way to cope with their emotions or communicate effectively  for example they may feel that they failed as parents somehow but they take their frustrations out on you  maybe their disappointment comes off as anger or frustration directed towards you  maybe they feel powerless and the abuse gives them an outlet or a sense of control ie an unhealthy way of coping  this doesnt excuse them for treating you that way but can help in understanding that this may be all they know and the abuse is the problem not you  communicate  relationships are transactional meaning that what you do and say affects me and what i do and say affects you  one way we influence people is with the way we communicate our words body language actions tone of voice etc  if you dont say or do anything you are essentially communicating that it is acceptableinstead tell them clearly and respectfully every time their words or actions hurt you  sometimes people dont realize how their words and actions affect us or they dont know how else to say things but it is our responsibility to let them know and to set the boundaries  remember that while it is your parents responsibilities to manage their own emotions and communication it is your responsibility to take care of your ownyou could say something like when i hear you say that it really hurts please dont say things like that to me or even more clearly its not okay to talk to me that way  please find a more respectful way to say you need  each time you are correcting them and teaching them how to treat you  i realize that this doesnt always work because ultimately people are gonna do do what they want but these are ways that you can practice standing up for yourself  you may have to say these things over and over again but its better than not saying anything at all  not only will it help your self esteem but you will be modeling healthy boundaries and communication for your childnone of this is easy work and since people are so complex there isnt a quick and easy fix  i definitely recommend working with a therapist to explore whats keeping you stuck and how you can work through it  it would be awesome if your parents would be on board with learning some healthier ways to communicate as well  i hope this helps and things work out

937,if parents are divorced is it acceptable for a counselor to allow an exspouse to be present during a childs session,can a counselor take sides with one parent and allow a parent to order the child to tell the counselor every detail about what happened during the other parents visitation in order to help build a case for child custody,parenting,"i see a few issues herefirst the age of the child is important  if the child is considered an
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age  and age  no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions 
if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law"

945,does my daughter have a mental disability,my daughter is in later elementary school she cant color in the lines her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines,parenting,kids develop in different ways and different speeds it can sometimes feel like your kid has a delay because of these different ways of development if you have concerns about your childs development then addressing it with the school is the best solution they will be able to provide a full assessment if needed with an academic diagnosis as well as academic support

950,does my daughter have a mental disability,my daughter is in later elementary school she cant color in the lines her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines,parenting,there could be a number of things going on here for instance have her eyes been checked by an optometrist she might just not like writing or coloring she could be rushing through assignments so that she can spend time with friends play games or do something else she might need some extra help with fine motor skills what are her grades like does she rush through other things like cleaning her room or getting ready for bed

952,my daughter isnt acting her age,my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of  she then started to act younger than she is    now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,parenting,this is certainly an important issue to look into it is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs developmental history also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family  andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point
953,my daughter isnt acting her age,my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of  she then started to act younger than she is    now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,parenting,your daughter is fortunate to have an observant parent who is willing to seek out help in this regard regression can be indicative of some stress in your childs life so the issues she is facing should be examined seeking advice from your daughters pediatrician as well as a practitioner familiar with adolescent issues or perhaps play therapy can equip you with insight into the causes of the behavior and give you tools to assist your daughter in learning age appropriate social interactions
954,my daughter isnt acting her age,my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of  she then started to act younger than she is    now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,parenting,helloit sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior    its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on   you are clearly an observant and hands on  mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is okthis is a tough question to answer without more information   with that said  i have found that under stress people regress  in other words  many people  children and adults alike  often regress and behave differently  as if they were younger than their actual age  when under stress    therefore  my first question would be  has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress   this could be anything from conflict at home  recent changes such as moving  divorce  a loss of some kind  switching schools  or losing a friend or friends    additionally  sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers  they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence     i would suggest that you think about what stressors  changes may have occurred recently  you may also want to check in with her teacher s to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughters behavior at school i also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her  something as simple as  i have noticed that you arent spending time with the friends you used to hang out with  it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately   am i right about that   and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as  did something happen with your friends that  is making you not want to be with them has something been bothering you lately  are you feeling upset or worried   if she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say  i know that sometimes when i feel stressed or worried  i tend to act a little differently  sometimes i withdraw from my regular group of friends  or i get cranky and feel less like myself   i wonder if something like that is happening with you  if you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and  or her teachers  perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might  help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times  or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively  the more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter  including any changes or new stressors   any possible patterns to this behavior  if school has become more difficult socially and or academically  the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her good luck   i believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of childrens behavior  i do though think that you will feel more assured about this  if you can get to the bottom of whats going on 
955,my daughter isnt acting her age,my daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of  she then started to act younger than she is    now she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesnt act her age i dont know why this is happening is this normal,parenting,good for you to know your daughters friendship circles and to notice when these have changedwhile friendships are key relationships they are not the only indicator of someone not developing normallyis your observation and opinion that your daughter isnt normal based on other factors or just this oneif this is the only factor then start with reflecting on what circumstances may be influencing your daughter to socialize with younger kidshas she ben ostracized or bullied by her peers and may be retreating to avoid further emotional hurtis she keeping up with her school worksometimes kids who feel overwhelmed by schoolwork will regress into conditions in which they feel more success and controlare there family circumstances such as the death of someone with whom your daughter felt close  or is there a new younger sibling in the family or a younger sibling who due to their own circumstance receives more attention than your daughter may wish for herselfonce youve reflected on which areas may be affecting your daughter gently ask her some questions about her comfort with what you theorize may be the source of the problemits also possible that offering her your extra time and interest may increase her sense of self so that she feels secure enough to increase her social time with her age group
956,how do i discipline a child with autism,i am a counselor at day camp where we have a child with severe autism we try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else the day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen so we just talk in a calm voice however other kids see the treatment as unfair,parenting,behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family membersit is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not to expect both sides to get along harmoniouslyin order to achieve this the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autismthis would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isnt part of summer camp for childrenwhat you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administratorsultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates
957,how can i help my son succeed in life when he refuses it,when my son was a teenager we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude a week after he graduated his dad made him leave because of the same issues all four parents tried to talk to him and he just refuses help all around he is now living with his grandparents he had a job and took steps to get his license and an insured vehicle i thought he was heading down the right road and then he tells me he quit his job because he didnt like it i just dont know what to do,parenting,probably the best way to be supportive of your son is to tell him what bothers you about the way hes handling himselfif youd like him to work with your suggestions then before you make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talentspeople are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of themoffer your availability to talk with him if you genuinely feel available to speak with him in a nonjudgmental way
958,how can i help my son succeed in life when he refuses it,when my son was a teenager we sent him to live with his dad because of the constant disrespectful attitude a week after he graduated his dad made him leave because of the same issues all four parents tried to talk to him and he just refuses help all around he is now living with his grandparents he had a job and took steps to get his license and an insured vehicle i thought he was heading down the right road and then he tells me he quit his job because he didnt like it i just dont know what to do,parenting,i admire your efforts you can continue to offer assistance for your son but it is ultimately up to him to decide what to do with the information or ideas that you are giving to himone thing you might try is to ask questions in a way that enables you to learn more about what he is experiencing for example if he is willing to talk to you about what he does on a daily basis andor what he would like to be doing you may be able to get a sense of what he finds difficult and find some resources to helpi might ask things like this just as examplescan we talk for a few minutes about some things that i would like to learn more aboutim just looking to learn more about what has been happening for you recently and im not trying to make you do anythingi know you said you quit your job because you didnt like it could you tell me more about what you liked and what you didnt likedo you see yourself doing the same kind of job in the futurewhat is it that makes you happy or what is it that you look forward to doingcan you think of anything that i can do to be of support to youif he is interested you may be able to connect him with an area community college to learn more about possible job opportunitieswith the way that i wrote the questions above it probably sounds like its relatively easy in reality it may not be an easy conversation and your son may choose not to discuss it with you if thats the case id remind yourself that you are trying to do everything you can
959,i lied to my mom then felt bad and told her the truth,she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,parenting,you felt bad when you lied so you told the truth  i imagine your mom was really shocked and upset  both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person  its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child from whom she always assumed honesty was capable of being dishonest  thats not awesome but its not the end of the world  you made a mistake  youll make more of those in your life just try not to make the same ones over and over againit sounds like you and your mom are close so i can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you  since you are a fundamentally honest person the way back to being trusted is going to be simple but may take a little time  the recipe is easy  say what you are doinggoing to do do only that unless change is necessary in which case you inform others involved and repeat  and cut yourself some slack  your mom will recover and so will you  its an important and painful lesson about integrity but once learned it will serve you well
960,i lied to my mom then felt bad and told her the truth,she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,parenting,it sounds like youve already learned that just being honest is often the best approach what do you think about telling your mom how youre feeling  she might really appreciate it if you also let her know that regaining her trust is really important to you
961,i lied to my mom then felt bad and told her the truth,she cried because she lost all trust in me now i feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed what do i do,parenting,hey sounds like the part of you that knows the right thing to do won here i am so proud of you for admitting that you lied to your mom sometimes lies come out of our mouths before we can even catch them because we are trying to say what the other person wants to hear i bet that as you begin to show her that you are not going to lie any more she will begin to gain trust in you again be open with your feelings with you mom  she is there to support you guide you and love you give her lots of hugs  and give yourself one too for being so brave be wise
962,i dont know what to do about my sons lying,my son stole my debit card and lied about it its not the first time he has lied i dont know what to do anymore i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong i have grounded him but nothing works what should i do,parenting,a lot depends on the age of your child but given that it was a misused debit card i am going to guess hes a teen  assuming that there are a couple of important things to keep in mind  that he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong  thats a dreadful feeling  getting caught out and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track   once he lied he stuck with the lie    somewhere along the line even though he knew that you knew he wasnt telling the truth he stuck with his story  and as you said its not the first time he lied  now it looks like a habit has formedgoing forward when there is a dishonest act of any kind its essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful  simply put do not ask questions  if you know for certain that he has for example misused your debit card say so  asking did you invites him to get creative with denial asking why did you implies that with a good enough reason he might not be in hot water with you  instead say what is  i see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission  you can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do  if he meets with denial stay calm restate that you are aware this happened  then deliver consequences that match the transgression he has to return the item if its returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it  make it harder to find your card because he isnt that great at curbing the impulse to use it yetand most importantly once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go  continuing to bring it up wont benefit him but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky  every time he asks respectfully to use it whether you allow him to or not be sure to praise him for asking nicely  catch him doing it right as often as possiblehang in there  this isnt super unusual behavior but it isnt acceptable so address it but dont let yourself get too wound up about it
963,i dont know what to do about my sons lying,my son stole my debit card and lied about it its not the first time he has lied i dont know what to do anymore i dont know if i should punish him or make him do something ive tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong i have grounded him but nothing works what should i do,parenting,hi enid you sound like a sensitive parent i like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong there is some key information here i dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but ill give you my thoughtsi see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world in order to accomplish that many of them test limits what can i get away with is a question they have to find the answer to if a child knows the rules theyre much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits so part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying not all kids steal but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point its a normal behaviour and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find out stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and im not surprised he lied about it if you absolutely know that he took it its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesnt do it again the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible the behaviour stealing was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea its funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we dont want people to know our mistakes its a dilemma if you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day that gives him incentive to come to you with truth it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty put a cookie on the counter tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day then ask them later if they took the cookie youre making honesty fun kids love games basically theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative if this is the first serious offence for your son dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns if its a pattern thats different and you may want the input of a therapist
964,im concerned about my  year old daughter,im concerned about my  year old daughter    about a month or two ago she started walking on her toes as well as coloring and writing very messy this all happened very suddenly she has never walked on her tiptoes and has always colored and written very neatly    is this something i should be concerned abou any advice will help,parenting,it is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter i cant offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think abouthas something else happen recently that has been stressful upsettingis your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that behave you discussed these recent changes with her without being too serious or accusatorythere is so much changing for her and you nowcommunication and connection are crucial i hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes

979,is it healthy to embarrass a child as punishment,my grandsons stepmother sends him to school with a pink barbie backpack as a form of punishment,parenting,absolutely not it is never in a childs best interest to use humiliation as punishment this can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the childs social relationships kids have a hard enough time to then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable the entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful healthy adult you do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake discipline shouldnt be seen as punishment it should be seen as a way to teach a lesson what lesson could this possibility be teaching him absolutely nothing meanwhile she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions she should be one of the people he can come to when hes hurting not someone who causes him pain

985,how do i quit letting little things bother me and be the mom that my kids deserve,,parenting,what you call little things may only seem little in general and to you are quite meaningful either in fact or because the little things represent much more serious matters in your lifetake your own feelings seriouslytrack the timeline of what is going on around the time you feel bothered by little things   also notice how youre feeling around the time youre feeling botheredthese two indicators may show you patterns of when and to what you are especially sensitivefor example if you usually feel bothered at the end of a pressured day then take care to arrange as far as possible relatively unstimulated and quiet surroundings around this sensitive timeif your kids are of the age at which they have language skills then you can also take some pressure off yourself and them by explaining your inner state of mind in general termspeople including kids always do better with more information than not knowing what is going on in their lives
986,how do i quit letting little things bother me and be the mom that my kids deserve,,parenting,well my first question was whether these are truly little things or things you really think the attentionif theyre really small things that you actually want to let go try looking at it on a continuum  of things that really get attention or correction and things that really dont  and everywhere in between looking at this on a scale  to  or  to  may be helpfulanother thing to do is consider trying to look at the world through their eyes you may have a better way of explaining things so that they learn from the correction that you try to give them rather than repeating yourselfalso recall that parenting working always have what theyre looking for permissive is not usually helpful just as the middle ground authoritative is better than very strict authoritarian according to most researchyou could also consider coming up with some affirming phrases for yourself such as its okay for this to happen or i know theyre not always going to get it right or i know that i cant always make them change overnightthis can be a really tricky balance to find and i recommend seeing a local mental health professional if increased awareness of different levels is not helpful to you
987,how do i quit letting little things bother me and be the mom that my kids deserve,,parenting,gratitude overly simplified but thats the trick when you can let in and celebrate the good stuff everything will start to find more balance our brains are fine tuned to focus on and highlight all the icky ugly stuff and file it away to try and avoid it in the future we dont process the good stuff in the same way its left over from our ancestral days when we needed to survive the saber tooth tiger but it doesnt always work so well these days slowing down and being mindful of the little things celebrating the tiniest details of what worksthats how you counter act that stuff check out my connectfulnesscomblog you may find some more tidbits there that help you shift gears

991,my daughter wont stop stealing and lying,her father and i have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now she is an adolescent and the problem is mostly food she is now overweight and we just dont know what to do anymore she can be disrespectful and doesnt listen to or respect what we say,parenting,i would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury the fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning i would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment they may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue
992,is it strange that a male family member always want to play with my toddler daughter,,parenting,without knowing the male family members reason for always wanting to play with your toddler yes it is strangefind out if the person has a reason for his preference and what this isare they studying child development in school and observing your toddler in order to write a paperis your male family member very shy or doesnt care for the other people in the household and plays with your toddler as a way to avoid thisyou dont have to ask this one simply observe and add this to what you already know about the personif no clear and respectable reason exists for your male family members preference to play with your toddler then i would definitely not allow the two of them to be alone together
993,how can i improve my relationship with my daughter,me and my adult daughter just do not get along shes very belittling to me when i dont agree with her its almost like she scolds me we get into all out war shes said i dont support her in what she does and that ive never loved her she calls me horrible names and she pushes my buttons to the point i call her names,parenting,as frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feelsto some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the otherdeveloping ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lotone major point to be aware is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic because it is strong may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adultswatch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority instead of considering her as a grown personthe same is true of your daughter  she may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she isher needs from you are real they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way
994,our grandson wants to talk to his estranged mom,we are the legal guardianship of our grandson he has been acting out and he wants to talk to his mom that has not talked to him since before last year how are we to handle this,parenting,hi boone this depends a lot on his age and the situation the younger the child is in general the more i would see this as your decision not his a child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution some questions was the parent harmful to the child is the parent likely to be harmful to the child how likely is it to be a positive experience do you have any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen  i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contactonce you determine the risk of the childs need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense  the older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves there are other options than a facetoface he can write to his mom or dad text or email its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort when a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents i wish him the best and im grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson youre very special
995,my daughter calls me crazy and im not sure how to handle that,i am divorced and happily remarried our blended family of children are in their s my youngest age  continues to call me crazy and favors her dad he was abusive to me and i left with injuries he never wanted kids and i did he paid child support only through forced wage earners now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past  years as a single mom i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core im not sure how to handle this,parenting,hi arkansas your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you its a form of woman abuse and child abuse hes likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and hes not considering how its affecting the kids ive seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent in some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless its your exs job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it while you cant change his behaviours and i think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids for your children you can refuse to enter into the war hes setting up hes trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you dont have to fall for this if you run around screaming hes lying it only makes you look more crazy try to stay calm and dont put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is one day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent they see who their dad is already id bet but they dont know how to cope with that if hes the only one fighting a war youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict dont engage on his level dont blame your children completely although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it they are acting out their fathers agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them you get the worst because they trust your love but you can still have boundaries letting them abuse you isnt the answer but have compassion for their position this picture isnt their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choicesreassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are you dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful it may take a while you cant rush it but they will see you for who you are your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on id recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded good luck
996,my daughter calls me crazy and im not sure how to handle that,i am divorced and happily remarried our blended family of children are in their s my youngest age  continues to call me crazy and favors her dad he was abusive to me and i left with injuries he never wanted kids and i did he paid child support only through forced wage earners now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past  years as a single mom i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core im not sure how to handle this,parenting,hi i understand what youre going through your daughters favor him because he has done no wrong in their eyes im guessing they lived with you growing up i was the same way i favoured my dad thinking he has done no wrong he also abused my mother multiple times and that never came to mind kids like their other parent more mainly because they dont see them everyday and they usually buy them everything they want because all he does it pay child support by force and then spoil their kids to make them happy you seem like a great mom dont doubt yourself
997,my daughter calls me crazy and im not sure how to handle that,i am divorced and happily remarried our blended family of children are in their s my youngest age  continues to call me crazy and favors her dad he was abusive to me and i left with injuries he never wanted kids and i did he paid child support only through forced wage earners now my daughters favor him after all the sacrifices i made for them the past  years as a single mom i dont deny them a relationship with their dad but to be called crazy and then watch them hang out with him hurts me to the very core im not sure how to handle this,parenting,it sounds really difficult to know that your daughter may be choosing her dad over you perhaps i can help by saying her intense emotional reactions towards you actually acknowledge how much safer and connected she feels towards you we tend to have big emotions around those we care for most i would suggest to let her know how hard it is to hear that and sad it make you feel at times and that this is hard for everyone expressing your feelings to here will allow her to express hers too
998,i feel like there is a wedge between my daughter and i,we live with my expartners sister and her husband we have been there for five years now they are hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent they neglect to see this i do and it reflects in my childs behavior she sees them as stable but is upset that her dad isnt here and my intuition tells me she blames me to a degree because she doesnt know about his alcohol addictions,parenting,hi new york im happy to hear that your daughter doesnt know about her dads addictions although you dont say how old she is and i imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth i trust your instinct that now is not the time your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here and i can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent as much as this helps your daughter i sense that you also know you cant take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent children tend to blame themselves for a parents absence these children need extra love and support wherever they can get ityou say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter i understand that having your ex partners relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times it is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter but its also natural for people to want to assist you lets trust that their intentions are good if there is no evidence to the contrary as much as they support you they also  have emotional ties to your daughters father while there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation there are also many positive factors here that i invite you to seei dont know what your culture is but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her fathers heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life in general the more adults around loving and supporting a child the better it could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her fathers family nothing anyone else does can take your daughters love from you my hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has they are potentially wonderful connections and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they dont harm heri suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your exs family if you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy united supportive and loving safety net for herthats the best outcome of all
999,my brothers exgirlfriend doesnt want her son to see us anymore,my brother just broke up with his girlfriend while they were dating for the past two years her son spent the weekends with me and my mother now she doesnt think her son should have any interaction with us how should we approach the situation is she doing the right thing for her child,parenting,hi tampa i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact in my book the more people loving a child the better but ultimately she has the right to make these decisions to oppose her wont likely do any good you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well
1000,my mentallyill motherinlaw wants to babysit,my motherinlaw is mentally ill she has been for most of her life she cuts herself she has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about  years she has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself she has had multiple shock therapy treatments and shes on enough medication to take down an elephant her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boyhe is now in his late s she doesnt even have custody of herself she hasnt asked yet but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child how do i go about saying no without creating an issue,parenting,hi fontanathanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question it seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response i like your healthy boundaries and ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her first she hasnt asked yet and you dont know that she will right now you can pleasantly ignore her hints theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them theyre more likely to go away you can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if shes offended that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations so the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry you might never have to face that moment but i understand that you want to be preparedas her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come is he willing to do this but if you are comfortable and if youre the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it wont happen and i would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later no need to apologize or hum and hawwe love that you want to be around junior and we definitely want you in hisher life try to leave out the but here youre not in a healthy place and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your ownif she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries id let her know that its not negotiable that you understand if shes disappointed but youre not open to discussing the issue really theres nothing to discuss learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life i wish you the best
1001,should i take my daughter to therapy,my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,parenting,has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitationor is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughterif no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up no one has even asked where she is why she isnt present then i dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter than the father is willing to make for seeing herif your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or notthe one move id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated
1002,should i take my daughter to therapy,my daughter didnt see her biological father for the last three years she doesnt want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse the visitation is with supervision but she refuses to see him is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy,parenting,hi dillonim from canada so i dont know the laws in your state it depends on that a good deal perhaps in my opinion a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe even if it is supervised if the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent then this should be honoured unfortunately the laws dont always uphold a parents right to do what is best for their child i recommend you see a lawyer who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreementsif you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy that is a separate question or is she already in therapy a family therapist will typically meet with you alone first in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child it isnt always appropriate
1003,i cant leave my negative environment without leaving behind my fiancé,my fiancé and i have been in a relationship for two years we have an infant son my fiancé also has a child from a previous relationship we do not live together i live with my mother currently while i get on my feet and hes living with some friends my mother and i have an awful relationship that is completely unbearable most of the time we cannot even stand to be around one another while living in the same house she has made it clear that she wants me gone recently i was talking to my father who lives in a different state my father and i have always had a good relationship i explained to him the situation i am in with my mother and he said he would like for me my fiancé and our son to come live with him and his wife i would really love to go i do not want my son to be in this environment with constant arguing and negativity any longer there is nowhere else for me to stay while remaining in this state the problem is my fiancé is refusing to move away with me because he does not want to leave behind his other child he and his childs mother have a horrible relationship and she would absolutely not be willing to let him visit if we moved away i believe i would be doing what is best for my child by moving away but i do not want to leave without my fiancé i have already explained the situation to him and he will not give in do i continue to stay in this negative environment with my child and keep our family together do i move away with my child and have my relationship end i do not want to take him out of either of his kids lives what do i do,parenting,hi bethlehemyou have a big decision to make  i appreciate your fiancés need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe placeim a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together i get that you want your dad to take care of all of you but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent i say that without knowing how old you are but if you have a child and a two year relationship you basically have declared your independence anyway  i wish you the best
1004,my child urinated in his mothers drink,just wondering if this is a deviant act and if i should be concerned for him he isnt quite ,parenting,well its certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so i would wonder if this child is trying to say somethingi think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on if there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly
1005,should i leave my boyfriend,my boyfriend has a child he gets every other weekend he goes to see her twice a week or more every time she leaves he gets into these funks like when his mom died when shes here shes disrespectful and his answer is well i dont know what to tell you she swears and talks back and he laughs he and her mom have been apart for three years and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young we never have adult time when shes not here shes the golden child and he wont listen to anyone,parenting,hi lockport building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky you dont tell us whether you live together or not if you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the home a bottom line for me is you dont tell someone else how to parent thats for your boyfriend to decide when hes there hes the parent and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree or you think you see something that hes not seeing its simply not for you to interfere there it sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support he has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned do you talk about these things can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to doalthough i suggest you leave the parenting to him what you can do is tell him what you see offer suggestions if hes open to it and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you it makes sense to say i see you struggling and i dont know how to help ive noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her are you aware that its coming across this way do you need help or i feel sad and frustrated when we dont spend any time alone together you sound a bit resentful of his daughter is it possible that your real struggle is about whether youre ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his childyou have a voice and its great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel ultimately however you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it 
1006,should i tell my kids that santa is real after their dad told them he is not,my exhusband told my two adolescents that santa doesnt exist on the day before christmas they are desperate to hold on to the magic of christmas but i dont know if its right for me to lie to them and tell them that santa is real i dont want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories but i also dont want to lose their trust,parenting,well boise the cats out of the bag now isnt it i love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of christmas they must want that too if they still believe in santa into their teen years which is unusual i believe i wonder if they had already figured it out anywaybut they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best so its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and christmas can still be magical in so many ways really who says they have to stop believing in santa santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and love
1007,how can i help my kids get along,for the last year my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting im at my wits end how can i get them to stop and get along,parenting,that is a good question unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict
1008,how can i help my toddler with toilet training when he gags every time he sees his poop,my toddler is having a real hard time with toilet training he almost throws up every time he sees his poop he gags and will not go on the toilet we have tried a toilet chair and ring that goes on the bigboy toilet but he refuses to use it when he sits on the toilet he just sits there forever and only will pee he holds the poop in until he get up and then will poop in his diaper i dump his diaper in the toilet and let him know that it is where it goes to try to encourage him how can i help him get over this fear and passed the stress,parenting,your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained you dont say how old he is so im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so i suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again in general teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively
1009,my parents arent letting my boyfriend and i talk or see each other while im pregnant,"im a senior high school student im also five months pregnant i got pregnant by my boyfriend of three years my parents dont want us to communicate with each other he cant even come to visit my gynecologist my mom goes to attend all of my doctors appointments shes supportive of me i wish though that my boyfriend was next to me and be able to see his daughter on a sonogram at the very least my family does not understand that he deserves that much i cry all the time because i feel lost and hopeless

 instead of watching my husbands harsh behavior i decided to sit beside my son and together we worked on his science assignment in order to encourage him to study my husband got upset and he was swearing at me he threatened me i knew that he was not joking his words scared me a lot",parenting,i have had these many cases but in situations like this if it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective

1014,how can my boyfriend forgive me when i cant forgive myself,i have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now in the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating we argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work i used to party a lot and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else these situations were never more than just kissing i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me i love him so much and want to work things out too but im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me i cant seem to forgive myself im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness,selfesteem,hi cerritosthis is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness you are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made you dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man you only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made were you shamed as a child did you learn that you deserved to be punished did something bad happen that you thought was your fault is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for there is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for the bar is too high for you if i was your therapist i would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that wound if you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you cant erase it and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore you have done many things here that you can feel proud of youve come clean youve been honest youve taken responsibility for your actions youve not tried to minimize what you did and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend these are all things you can use to build your sense of worth you are acting very honourably its time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that youve learned from them and are a better person now its not our mistakesnot our worst moments that define usits how we handle them afterwardsi wish you growth and happiness
1015,how can my boyfriend forgive me when i cant forgive myself,i have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about six years now in the past our relationship was difficult and frustrating we argued a lot and due to that there was a lot of tension between us we stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work i used to party a lot and several times i got into situations where i would end up kissing someone else these situations were never more than just kissing i have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend and he decided to forgive and move forward with me i love him so much and want to work things out too but im having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me i cant seem to forgive myself im overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness,selfesteem,so wonderful to have a boyfriend who is able to understand and forgive you what do you think that he sees in you that allows him to do that does he see someone who like other humans makes mistakes does he see someone who despite hurtful choices is a good person committed to being a loving respectful partner the compassion and understanding that we can often extend to others can be difficult to extend to ourselves we often hold very unrealistic and perfectionist expectations for ourselves which may even lead to our poor choices in the first place  as a ways of letting off steam or rebelling against our high standards regardless of the reasons we all make mistakes and imperfection does not make someone less loveable  it just makes them human if your boyfriend is able to start clean with you there must be a reason what you do from here on out will define the kind of partner you are to him can you treat him with the kind of respect that you would want can you help him to feel loved and safe in the relationship can you allow yourself to be imperfect and afraid and still worthy of love and acceptance when you are feeling ashamed of your behaviours  try to imagine extending that scared part of you the same love and acceptance that you might extend to other people who have made mistakes it is not easy to forgive ourselves but it is important in order to allow ourselves to be loved and to truly love others

1017,i sometimes i feel like i hate myself,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,aside from seeing a therapist to help you work through the feelings and events that might have resulted in the selfhatred i recommend a few things  draw a line down the page in a journal to make two columns  in the first column write down your negative thoughts  on the other side in the second column write down a different statement to challenge that thought  pretend you are a judge trying to prove the negative thought wrong  for example you might change i wasnt good enough to it wasnt about me or im actually really good at x y and z    write down a new positive self statement each day and focus on each one on your list for  minutes more if you can the more the better  meditate on the truth of each of these statements  this method has been proven to be effective in improving self esteem  practice nonjudgmental awareness  be curious about your experience  notice your emotions and where they are coming from  my guess would be that if youre hating yourself then there is probably some shame guilt sadness andor anger that needs to be addressed  these emotions might fit the facts or not  if they do here are some things you can do if not then practice the methods aboveshame fits the facts if a person or group of people you care about will reject you if they knew the truth  try talking to someone who will not reject you about what youre ashamed of  be very careful to pick someone who will validate you and not cause more shame a therapist will help with thisguilt fits the facts when youve done something that violates your own values or moral code  try making amends if youve hurt someone  practice selfvalidation or talking with someone who will validate you and forgiving yourself  use it as motivation to making a commitment to change your behavior if necessarysadness fits the facts when you lost or will be losing someone or something you care about  practice letting yourself feel sad and grieve  maybe process it with someone who supports you or through a creative outlet like art or writinganger  fits the facts when someone or something has threatened you or a loved ones life or wellbeing  anger motivates us to protect ourselves and our loved ones  practice setting boundaries and seeking justice if necessary  practice self compassion  imagine someone you care about is going through the same thing  what encouraging or loving words would you say to them  write that down  now read it back to yourself  building mastery is a great skill for confidence and improving your mood  that means doing things that give you a sense of confidence like learning or practicing a new skill    step out of your comfort zone and do things that youre afraid of that are not harmful like participating in toastmasters to practice public speaking  give yourself permission to suck and try not to judge yourselfthese things can be very helpful but there may be more work to do to really get to the root of the problem and heal  this is pain trying to get your attention  dont ignore it  find support and give yourself grace

1020,i sometimes i feel like i hate myself,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,one of the ways that can help you practice acceptance  of self is by using selfcompassion researcher kristin neff recommends that taking a daily selfcompassion break can be beneficial in that it can transform harboring feelings of isolation such as those hating yourself  to an experience of connection a selfcompassion break consists of placing your hand over your heart and acknowledging that you are having a difficult time believing in yourself but that you recognize you are not alone as suffering is ubiquitous so you are connecting with the rest of humanity you can then say encouraging words to yourself either silently or out loud such as may i be led every day to recognize my strengths and to love myself or may i find peace within myself and strengthen my selfbelief apart from selfcompassion i would encourage you to keep a selfesteem journal in order to engage in expressive writing and write about your strengths so that you can start to build selfacceptance

1024,i sometimes i feel like i hate myself,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,self love and self acceptance is something that many of my clients struggle with so i can assure you that you are not alone we are bombarded by media and advertisements everyday that try to sell us things to make us somehow better thus leading us to believe that we are not enough unfortunately i believe that low self esteem is a social epidemicon a more personal level do you have any sense of what types of messages you have received in your life that have led to these self defeating thoughts for example did a parent or another loved one criticize you or put you down often were you bulled in school has a romantic partner emotionally abused you usually there are factors such as these which insidiously lead to low self esteem and self loathing once you can identify some of the factors that lead to your self hatred you can make a decision to not let these things from your past have such power over you any more you learn to take control of how you feel about yourself rather than letting others dictate that for you i do think it is possible to heal from self hatred it doesnt happen over night and it takes time and effort it is about retraining your brain to focus on your strengths rather than on your weaknesses none of us are ever going to be perfect and if we look for a flaw we are bound to find one or two or three try keeping a self esteem journal every night write down three things that you were proud of that day about yourself try reciting positive affirmations every day such as i am lovable and beautiful just the way that i am today to reprogram your mind into thinking highly of yourself rather than poorly
1025,i sometimes i feel like i hate myself,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,the most important word here is sometimes i know it is quite painful and i can imagine that at times this pain doesnt feel like it will subside but it sounds like it is not all the time which means we can easily say that this hate myself experience is one part of you there are many other parts if you give them some space to also speak up that will offer you more positive regard trust me on that generally speaking we just dont know how to listen to those parts becauseit is the i hate myself part that is our inner critic and often our inner critic has developed a lot of strength throughout our life because of how weve depended on it for certain things sounds crazy but in actuality some of the most successful people in work mainly are those that have strong inner critics they use these critics to motivate themselves but with people and in relationships and in our relationship with ourselves it completely backfires because relationships are far more dynamic processes than doing well at workso try to acknowledge that the inner critic is one part of you that youve learned to give a lot of space to but if you sit with even a remotely positive feeling you have it can also be given the space to speak up and grow just like the critic has over time
1026,i sometimes i feel like i hate myself,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,the answer would require a more indepth knowledge of you and your situation a lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way you internalize it and accept it as your reality the first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents even if you are an adult think back to your childhood children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems the obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a personyou may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally were you yelled at berated put down were you told youd never amount to anything were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldnt live up to expectations when you hear something over and over again you start to believe itmaybe you werent yelled at maybe it was the opposite studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect a chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless she may have been less likely to show interest in a childs life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being metany of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they dont mattermaybe nothing ive described here fits your situation if you cant pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can helpi am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you theres nothing you can do to change it quite the opposite understanding why you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition  figure out the why then behavior  the how
1027,i sometimes i feel like i hate myself,i feel like i hate myself physically and emotionally sometimes how can i start accepting myself and be more confident,selfesteem,this happens slowly and can be doneyou already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself not that the feelings of selfloathing are the best of what youre able to expect from lifea way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisionsif you start to notice what youd like from an interaction and afterwards reflect on how well you handled yourself especially with any unexpected circumstances youll build confidence in your ability to be good at somethingdo you know why you hate yourselfthis answer may help you address within yourself  a new type self talk which has more positives in it than what youve been accustomed to telling yourself
1028,how do i cope with never being good enough,im always told im not good enough or trying hard enough i put  in to every thing im worn out ive worked on all of my family relationships im doing great in school im kind to those in need and otherwise i stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so i dont have to make as many and the ones i do i learn from  somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works nothing has changed and i feel hopeless any suggestions or ideas,selfesteem,hello and let me say first what a great question there are so many people putting forth their  everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionfirst i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough is that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern if so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if its a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals no one will ever be  good enough for everyone every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives the question becomes what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations there is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really you youre trying to feel good enough for if you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on letting go of the rest no one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left after all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowi recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra no one can make you feel inferior without your consent   eleanor roosevelt

1030,how do i cope with never being good enough,im always told im not good enough or trying hard enough i put  in to every thing im worn out ive worked on all of my family relationships im doing great in school im kind to those in need and otherwise i stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so i dont have to make as many and the ones i do i learn from  somehow its still not good enough and nothing i do works nothing has changed and i feel hopeless any suggestions or ideas,selfesteem,im sorry that you feel this way despite all you do and as hard as you try  no wonder youre feeling worn out and hopeless  if youre doing your best and its still not good enough then its reasonable to expect that you would end up feeling burnt out  its like theres no more fuel to keep your fire going  i would encourage you to approach this with curiosity  in what areas are you not feeling good enough  what does good enough even mean  how are you measuring your success   is it measured by what other people say whether or not they approve or what other people think  is it measured by your own expectations expectations of a boss a parent or a partner  are they realistic and achievable expectations  i once had a boss who always gave negative feedback and criticism  i started to get to the point where i questioned my career and whether or not it was for me  when i took a step back and checked the facts i realized that the feeling of being not good enough was coming up mostly in my interactions with my boss  when i found myself thinking of quitting i realized that it might be helpful to try talking to her about it first  as scary as it was it made a huge difference  i practiced the skills i teach my clients including constructive criticism and assertive communication  i told her that as much as i appreciated her trying to help by giving me feedback i found myself feeling very discouraged after our meetings  i braced for her response which actually came to me as a surprise  she admitted that many people have told her the same thing and that it wasnt me  she said that it was her own stuff that she needed to work on   after that i chose to focus on the evidence that i was doing well and that my job has meaning and value  i realized that good enough is how i choose to define it  i worked on letting myself be human and realizing that i am doing my best and thats good enough and that doesnt mean i cant still learn and grow  giving yourself permission to be human and stop judging yourself so harshly creates space for learning and growing without burning out  it also gives you a sense of peace because youre not trying to live up to unrealistic expectations  its saying im okay as i am regardless of what anyone says or thinks  its also saying im doing my best and i can do better try harder and be more motivated to changebottom line is if you check the facts youre doing great in many ways  so whether the not good enough message is coming from outside or within try to replace it with another narrative  maybe something like im okay as i am even if i make mistakes and im always learning  if youre getting criticism from others try talking to them about it  let them know how they can best support you  maybe that means celebrating your accomplishments with you no matter how small  most likely they want whats best for you and dont realize how their actions are affecting you  if they dont want whats best for you then you might want to consider how you can filter them out of your life or set healthy boundaries with them  keep your head up and stay focused on your strengths  the fact that you are reaching out for help shows that youre proactive and openminded hang in there and it will get better

1033,how can i get over my exboyfriend cheating on me,its been almost a year since my exboyfriend broke up with me after he cheated on me many times i had found out about a month before but i hadnt told him i knew because i didnt want us to break up i used to have very low selfesteem and i think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic my father cheated on my mother when i was little i wonder if this pain has to do with that my exboyfriend and i were only dating for five months but i still cant get over this betrayal im not sure what to feel to get over it forgiveness hate he helped me financially after our break up by lending me  so im grateful for that i still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although were not even talking anymore we follow each other on instagram and thats it i feel like i still need his validation this is haunting me day and night i want to focus on my new relationship and goals but i keep obsessing over this and keep checking my exboyfriends instagram and facebook i feel so bad and keep having nightmares,selfesteem,the dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationshipcontinue developing some points youve written herethat you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her very likely set a standard in your inner self to expect similar circumstances in your relationship lifethis is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us  what we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as normal no matter how bad it actually isafter all children dont have the ability to separate that what their own parents do is wrong compared with the rest of our cultureit is natural to long for a relationshipwhat you have the chance to do now is distinguish the reasons for your longingis it to attach to someone who has hurt you hasnt shown you any understanding of having hurt you and whose validation even if he says validating words has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm usif youre able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime
1034,why do i feel like i can never meet peoples expectations,i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me,selfesteem,it sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsone possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult you ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and i hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer
1035,why do i feel like i can never meet peoples expectations,i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me,selfesteem,it is not unusual to believe that we know what other people are thinking about and feeling towards us  these beliefs which can sometimes be quite upsetting are based on our own life experiences including previous interactions with family friends and strangers  no matter how good we think we are at reading others we dont usually know what someone else is thinking  additionally low selfesteem may lead us to assume that we could never meet others expectations or that other people couldnt possibly have positive thoughts about or feelings towards us  assumptions like these may unnecessarily lead to negative emotional states  one method of coping with these thoughts is cultivating a sense of curiosity  for example asking for direct feedback may point out the overly critical nature of our own thoughts  another technique is to use a balanced selfappraisal  for example you could ask yourself what did i do well here and what would i do differently in the future  this approach has the benefit of recognizing our own strengths while also employing a growth mindset  additionally by using a presentfocused appraisal we avoid engaging in the belief that we should have done better in the past  rather we have the opportunity to improve with the information we learn in the present  a therapist may also be helpful in exploring and coping with these thoughts
1036,why do i feel like i can never meet peoples expectations,i feel like every time i do something someone asks me to i never fully meet what they want i feel that when i finish it they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it i feel like they just want nothing to do with me,selfesteem,as long as you try to reach others expectations you will never feel satisfied or accepted  how about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those  make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic

1052,my relationship is suffering from severe abandonment issues,i feel as though im suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood i convince myself im not worthy of happiness and im always afraid im doing something wrong its as if i create little scenarios in my mind and i start to believe them,selfesteem,this is an understandable response to early childhood trauma and loss  oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults  especially when we get close to someone it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life  soour body nervous system and emotions respond in the same way  they feel as if what we experienced when we were little is happening now and they go into full force to manage and protect us  sometimes the ways that happens can feel pretty bad and we can stuck in these loops of old beliefs about ourselves  therapy is a great way to interrupt these patterns process the early experiences and be able to be in the present with your current relationships  it is very possible to shift this cycle and also have meaningful healing from the experiences that caused so much hurt and distress from childhood
1053,my relationship is suffering from severe abandonment issues,i feel as though im suffering severe abandonment issues stemming from childhood i convince myself im not worthy of happiness and im always afraid im doing something wrong its as if i create little scenarios in my mind and i start to believe them,selfesteem,i would like to offer my compassion that you are struggling with with these feelings with the information provided and not knowing what your childhood was like or what youve experienced i will say that from my experience working with people these feelings are normal and a normal part  of the process  of healing and just by posting your question tells me youre aware and desire to change this very good i commend your strength your feelings are not uncommon and the feelings of abandonment or second guessing or loss of happiness are also not uncommon  its also not uncommon for these issues to arise and trickle into our adult life and relationships again with little information about your situation it is hard to give an exact answer however those who have experienced a dysfunctional childhood or trauma often present with the issues and feelings youve described the great news is that with good therapy you can regain your happiness self worth and begin to feel  empowered you deserve to be happy be patient gentle and kind  to yourself i would encourage you to begin with searching for a licensed therapist in your area maybe go for a consultation session  and simply see how your feel about it therapy can be incredibly helpful and life changing i wish you the very best laura cassity lmsw lmac

1059,how can i learn to like myself,,selfesteem,for some people it really is about learning to love and like yourself  learning this often starts with understanding what gets in the way of you liking or loving yourself  and more often than not it is the messages our brain sends that have an extremely powerful affect on how we view ourselves  the brain is very powerful in tricking us that we are ugly or dumb or not worthy and so on  but what is amazing and beautiful is that our brain has great capacity to be rewired to no longer accept the negative messages but instead replace them with more realistic and more loving messages  seeing a therapistcounselor can be a great resource to help you learn to fight those messages

1061,how can i learn to love and like myself and whats in the mirror,,selfesteem,ill offer two tools to consider a bar and a puzzle piece what most people compare themselves to others  ie im not as good looking as jaime im not as cool as corey the person you might do better to look at is you what cool thing did i do today that i didnt do yesterday how did i do my hair in that picture that made me feel a little bit better looking moving the bar away from others and towards yourself can be helpful in building selfesteem another tool that can be helpful is that puzzle piece i cant think of anyone who loves everything about themselves starting from the smallest part of yourself what is one attribute you do like about you psychology has long recognized that its far easier to come up with a list of dislikes than likes especially when it comes to ourselves or our circumstances maybe you have really great toes maybe you have an infectious grin maybe youre really fantastic at s trivia build a list of those small things those puzzle pieces of great things about you and in time you might find you like all of you best of luck
1062,how do i save my marriage,what am i doing wrong my wife and i are fighting all the time what can i do we dont agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions which are usually wrong on how i feel she is very familyoriented while all of my family left me on my butt abused ignored and messed up with me mentally im not a familyoriented person i only have two people in my life  my best friend and my wife    my mother forced my father out of my life so i do not know who he really is weve gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much i look like her when in fact i look more like him this makes me mad because i dont want to look like my mother i hate her all that she did was bring me down and make me homeless which she was successful at i need guidance in my life i dont want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and its not healthy im dying to make our relationship healthy ive never wanted anything more than this please help me i need your advice,selfesteem,hello it sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage i cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent there are no easy answers to your questions and i wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain but i can maybe give some thoughts and reflections first and foremost cut yourself some slack no one is perfect we fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop you probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach you have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsjoining a marriage support group can also be helpful you can find these through local counseling resources sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful if you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youlastly parents are imperfect yepits true they had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage we limp along and do our best having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us the bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life both with ourselves and toward other people so this becomes a guiding principle in our actions it may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit  i am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it if only one of you cares then  of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person thats not fair so be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution all of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life one way or the other you will benefit from itbe well
1063,how do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,i also want to note that we as a society are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves  i am sorry that this boy said something insensitive  there is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything  it also wasnt his place to judge you as women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others  men dont have the same range of societal expectations to navigate  you didnt deserve his rudeness
1064,how do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,first i think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing  you are putting yourself out there and becoming a water safety instructor   we often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive  next you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment  whether or not it was malicious on his part i think the important thing to focus on is what is called common humanity  common humanity is one of the three elements of selfcompassion  common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience  while you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day  we all have embarrassing moments  when we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering  additionally another element to selfcompassion is selfkindness  my question is why must you forgive yourself  rather be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent
1065,how do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,as far as i can tell you received unwanted attention but you didnt do anything wrong  what did your instructor say anything if the outfit was not appropriate then the instructor should tell youif heshe didnt then assume the swimsuit was okay but the gentleman in the class wanted your attention and took it upon himself to comment in order to get that attention  if you dont want his attention then you have a couple of choiceswear a shirt  over the swim top find an inexpensive swim top to replace the one you have or wear what you have as long as the instructor doesnt say anything and if you get unwanted attention say in as confident slightly loud voice as you can muster  i dont appreciate your critique of what im wearing were here to take a class lets just focus on that then  turn on your heel and walk away
1066,how do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,everybody does something or a few things in their life which looking back the person wishes they hadntthe key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doingyour mistake sounds genuine not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyonenow that this student in your class pointed out your mistake you will learn to notice the appearance of your swimwearput in context that feeling foolish for doing something embarrassing means that overall you generally do most activity in your life in nonfoolish waysthe incident would only bother someone who generally is responsible  the mistake is a contrast with what is usual behavior for youi hope youll enjoy swimsuit shopping and find a beautiful bargain
1067,how do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we cant change we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and selfblame but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes if you tune into your own thoughts or your internal dialogue youll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings so people who are holding onto embarrassment and selfblame often have thoughts like how could i do that i looked so stupid now people saw things i did not want them to see if we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it these are selfsabotaging thoughts that lead to shame selfblame and embarrassment if you look at the evidence you can find more rational thoughts such as  we all make mistakes people can look all different ways at different time  this incident does not define me and if someone has a bad image or thought about me it is really ok people have all kinds of thoughts about other people and it does not have to be a major problem when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones you will start to feel better more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly
1068,how do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself,i am becoming a water safety instructor but i didnt have enough for a proper swimsuit i was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything i was very embarrassed,selfesteem,first of all congratulations to you on becoming a water safety instructoras far as how to forgive yourself this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves no matter the subject on the other hand it sounds like the location of the mistake means that after you get through the class you wont see the same people much longer so hopefully the embarrassment will be temporaryas far as the class maybe you can give yourself compassion for the idea that we all make mistakes and it certainly sounds like it wasnt intentional i think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted directiontrying to make sure that the same thing doesnt happen again would probably be helpful but it sounds like you are already doing that something else you could do is think of something you can say to yourself when someone says something embarrassing about that occurrence such as it was an accident and i have fixed it nowyou may find some helpful tips here httptinybuddhacomblogletgopastmistakesstepsforgiving or here httppsychcentralcomlibhowdoyouforgiveyourself  these are not meant to be resources related to religion but it is mentioned in a few places
1069,i am very self conscious about my body,on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest    how do i fix this,selfesteem,i get how you feel you wish your body looked different and youre embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice you dont say how old you are its likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general were given the bodies were given and im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is you seem to want to stop disguising it bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what hers looks like many men go through this as well although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how were supposed to look young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them in fact other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatevers going on with you i suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear and if someone is rude enough to comment on it you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and theyll get the hint but my bet is they wont even notice 
1070,i am very self conscious about my body,on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest    how do i fix this,selfesteem,sometimes we let our insecurities get the best of us causing us to make some interesting choices honesty is always the best policy but honesty comes with risk  perhaps you may want to start with your family first explaining to them what you have done and why  perhaps they can help you to practice talking about your insecurities with your friends another way is to start slowly to dress more and more like yourself and your true body shape some of your friends may make fun of you true but then you must ask yourselfwhy do you want to be friends with people like that
1071,i am very self conscious about my body,on the first day of school i wore a bra that was too big so that it would look like i had bigger boobs i did that the whole school year and my parents never found out but now i can never hang out with my friends at my house or invite them over because it would be around my parents and my friends would see there is nothing there on my chest    how do i fix this,selfesteem,wear baggy clothes to disguise the problem and if you do this for a long enough time then your friends may forget what size boobs you havecan you tell your parents what you wrote here  if yes then maybe they will be empathetic and this always helpsthey may also agree to not make any comments about your boobs when you wear the bigger bra around your friends when they visit you at homealso its possible your friends already have questioned why you wore a bigger bra than your boobs  maybe they saw what was going on the whole time during the school year and felt too awkward to tell you

1077,why am i so nervous talking to people,whether its to a guy or girl i always feel insecure talking and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough even when i am walking i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,selfesteem,hi im glad you wrote because i think a lot of people have this same issue to different degrees and we dont talk about it much you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so thats a good thing but your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across as you age you understand this more and its truethat other people really arent thinking about you much or monitoring you at all theyre too busy having the same thoughts youre having am i good enough do people like me judge methink im weird were all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across like many people you lack compassion for yourself acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself my gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past our sensitivities usually come from as well as genetics a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times without more details its difficult to go further here i recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully
1078,why am i so nervous talking to people,whether its to a guy or girl i always feel insecure talking and i am afraid of embarrassing myself and not being good enough even when i am walking i worry about my appearance and facial expression and such,selfesteem,i want to add that one way therapy can help with social anxiety is to give you a corrective experience  each week you sit across from someone who genuinely cares about you who doesnt judge you and who you can voice your concerns to  over time you show them more and more of yourself and as they get to know you they still care about you they still dont judge you and they still think you are amazing  find a therapist you connect with
1079,how do i become more open minded or less irritable and happier,,selfesteem,
1080,what can i do about my roommates drinking problem,my roommate has had a drinking problem for a while she goes out gets trashed and then expects everyone to take care of her the next morning she apologizes constantly until she feels validated she also thinks everyone hates her all the time if i dont seem anything other than happy she asks me do you hate me you hate me tell me you love me and i feel like i have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before,selfesteem,it does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem and the short answer is that you cant do anything about it only she can we cant change what other people say think or do we can only change our reactions it does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time you can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy you can reassure her that you like her if thats true but you dont have to pity her
1081,how can i get past the hurt of being told by various significant others that i wasnt good enough to have a baby with,,selfesteem,im not really sure what not good enough means if multiple people have told you that one thing to consider is that they each had their own reasons for not wanting a child at that moment it is possible that it had nothing to do with youdid any of these significant others say anything about what made them feel that way i hope that you were able to talk about these ideas rather than them telling you what they thought and then not further discussing itwhat qualities do you want to see in the partner that you want to have a baby with what attributes do you have to give back to that relationship
1082,how can i care less about what people think,i always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people i know that no matter what i do or how i change there will always be some people who hate me why do i feel this way,selfesteem,my first reaction to this is that it sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside build yourself up on the inside work on yourself use positive affirmations daily it would be wise for you to research some selfconstruct theory and do some selfconcept workhope this helpsc
1083,how can i care less about what people think,i always feel the need to impress people whether its my family the people at school or just random people i know that no matter what i do or how i change there will always be some people who hate me why do i feel this way,selfesteem,it is normal to seek others attention and noticing that some people would not be interested  after all we belong to a social environment where we constantly receive others feedback which at times validates us makes feel important and useful like we belong but also at times makes us feel isolated different and neglected which we could interpret as hatethe key is to be aware of what you think about what people think of you   got it  this part can be tricky at times because what others think about us does not really affect us what really affects us is what we decide to believe internalize and make our reality  for example i could choose to ignore a persons comment about me or i could decide to focus on it all day analyze why they said that and what have i done to them to get to that conclusion  eventually since we became so focused on that thought we may end up believing that what the other person said about us was true even if we did not agree to begin withso how can we fix this  awareness is the key  it is important that you understand the way you internalize external inputs like comments and to go through a process of discarding negative ones  it is also helpful to talk to your counselor about how you process feedback and validation so you learn to balance your positive traits from negatives and how that affects your relationships and selfesteemcómo me puede importar menos lo que la gente piensasiempre siento la necesidad de impresionar a otros ya sea mi familia la gente de la escuela o extraños  y sé que no importa lo que haga o cuanto haga siempre habrá personas que me odian  por qué me siento asíes común que busquemos la atención de otros y notemos que algunas personas no están interesadas  después de todo pertenecemos a un ambiente social donde constantemente recibimos comentarios que a veces nos validan alagan y nos hacen sentir como parte importante y funcional de la sociedad pero en otros momentos nos hacen sentir aislados ignorados y diferentes lo cual lo pudiéramos interpretar como odiola clave es estar conscientes de lo que pensamos que los otros piensan de nosotros me sigues  esta parte puede ser algo confusa porque lo que piensan otras personas de nosotros no nos afecta directamente lo que si nos afecta es lo que decidimos creer que otras personas piensan de nosotros y luego lo internalizamos y hacemos parte de nuestra vida  por ejemplo  podemos decidir ignorar lo que una persona dice de nosotros o podemos decidir enfocarnos en ello todo el día analizando en detalle porque lo dijeron y que hemos hecho para hacer que ellos piensen así eventualmente nos enfocamos tanto en ese pensamiento que terminamos creyendo que es verdad aun cuando originalmente no lo creíamos asíentonces como lo arreglamos la clave es concientización  es importante entender la manera en que internalizamos las opiniones de otros y que pasemos por un proceso de discriminación donde descartemos los comentarios negativos hasta que aprendamos a ignorarlos también ayudaría hablar con un consejero sobre como internamente validas y descartas los comentarios y opiniones externas y como eso puede estar afectando tus relaciones y tu autoestima

1086,how can i forgive myself,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,hello and thank you for your question guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck unfortunately it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away however i will give you some ideas and hopefully this will helpone of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesnt usually do much to help us in the longrun people may make changes for a shortterm period of time because they feel guilty about something they did but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they dont have something else to help them change permanently such as a new skill so guilt doesnt necessarily help us in fact as i write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol for whatever reason this is just a common thing that we do now accountability is different than guilt accountability can actually be constructive  when you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong that it hurt others and you deeply regret it that you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesnt happen again that you have done what you can to make amends if necessary that you are sorry and then you move on why is moving on necessary well for one thing it doesnt usually help the people who you hurt in fact someones guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt over and over again about what happened guilt is usually  about us and not about those we hurt also guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more having said all of that guilt is a normal human emotion sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away sometimes we need help to work through it there are many selfhelp books about forgiving yourself you can try amazon to find some or consider getting help from a counselor be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
1087,how can i forgive myself,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,a lot of times it is not about forgiveness but learning from experiences as an example as a child we continously fall in an effort to learn how to walk then when we begin walking we know we have to put one foot in front of the other in order to move forward experiences allow us to grow find a balance and what to do and what not to do in order to move forward on the positive side you now know the consequences as for your actions not to take the same course forgiveness comes with time as you learn how to walk again
1088,how can i forgive myself,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,realize that you are human not perfect and will make the wrong decisions at times   that is ok we all have  however the best way is to say ok i did it learned from it will not do that again  ever  you can get pass it grow from it  unfortunately we forgive others faster than we do ourselves because we hold ourselves to higher standards or expected better behavior from ourselves  it can be embarrassing hurtful almost unforgiving at times  but how do you forgive yourself take a deep breathe and then acknowledge that you did something wrong acknowledge it and say to self  i forgive me  just like you would say to someone else   this starts the process of forgiving also ask yourself these questions   what lesson did i learn  what would i have done differently  what will be a trigger that will make me do that again if i happened to be weak or tempted  avoid or prepare for those triggers  forgiving yourself will set you free from the prison you have put yourself in  you would start back living
1089,how can i forgive myself,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,"what a beautiful discussion of guilt and shame lynda offers those
two demons start out as pesky and little when we are young then grow with us to
become quite formidable id like to throw in a technique i learned from randy
rausch author of the last lecture called the step apology
i teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize
to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselvesyes when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget
that there is part of us that just doesnt know how to apologize effectively
here goesstep one say what you did and the damage it causedstep two say youre sorry and accept full
responsibility no excuses no explanation no defensiveness it was all my
faultstep
three ask what you can do to repair the damagestep three is the one many of us didnt learn growing up and when
we add it to an apology we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light
as it is of course sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone
is offered so be it we cant control this but if we are apologizing to
ourselves we can there is always a way to make amends if we put our heart
into it
give this a try the next time youre reluctant to let yourself off
the hook you might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when
invited"
1090,how can i forgive myself,something happened this summer that i cannot forgive myself for when i think about what happened i feel ashamed and guilty even though my loved ones forgave me,selfesteem,hi ohio i totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot thats a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce ill get you startedyou feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident is it triggering some old shame unfortunately a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids it doesnt work when was the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame as in im bad or im worthless is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that wasnt your fault sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma if so picture yourself at that age can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them isnt their fault can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them thats your first goalto go to the source of the shame and heal that childs wound with compassion what happens to children is never their fault and fault is a pretty useless concept anywayonce you take the layers of old im bad shame off the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame here are some things you can say to yourselfevery dayim human and thats okay i dont have to be perfecti can have compassion for my mistakesi can feel proud that im facing my mistake and making things righti deserve forgiveness and compassion and i have that for other people tootheres no purpose to holding on to shamei can learn from my mistakes and move forwardeveryone makes mistakesother people dont want me to carry this shame aroundi dont need shame to remind me not to do it again ive figured that outshame tries to convince you that you need to carry it around in order to prevent further mistakes poppycock  youve learned your lesson now you can move forward to other mistakes sorrybut youre human and youll keeping making hopefully different glorious mistakes embrace the learning lean into the experiences of life its all juicy stuff and youre in good company were all in the same position of being mortal
1091,why do i feel like everyone hates me,i constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down its ruining my mood and even my whole self i have trouble sleeping and i keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me,selfesteem,the problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spiritare there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates youhave you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpointor does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind as though you anticipate that others will not like what you sayif actual conversations are leading you to feel left out then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other personor you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out are no longer worthwhile ones for youif the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others
1092,am i going to be alone forever,i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,selfesteem,"i can relate when things are going badly i feel like my life has
always been and will always be that way but i also do this when things are
going well that is i forget how good things can turn bad personally to
avoid this emotional rollercoaster i try and heed the famous advice by author
and feminist rita mae brown one of the keys to happiness is a bad
memoryso maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a
strength it sounds a lot like living in the moment to me and while its hard
to manage my past and my future the moment seems like a small enough piece of
temporal real estate to sort out so thats the what of my answer the how
goes like this choose one from column a two from column b and three from
column c in the following chart then try doing them for as long as you can
then see what happensa                                            b                                                  cgratitude                                forgiveness                                 appreciationexpectations                           meditation                                    exercisebitterness                               distraction                                    volunteering

think and believe are out of your control or that your values were imposed on
you or that nothing good will ever happen again then we will have to
respectfully disagree youve ask a very deep and insightful question proving
that your hope has gotten you this far hang onto that hope because im an
example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my lifeinstead of convincing
yourself that youre okay when youre not how about calling it accepting
yourself as okay just the way you are without judging your okayness you
probably have high standards perfectionism and thats a thing to talk with a
counselor about the opposite of perfect is not horrible its called good
enoughblocking out the bad things and
forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping all the other mammals do it
except when it comes to lifethreatening bad things so why shouldnt we this
might be called optimism
feeling alone and uncared for
is a worse feeling than being despised this is good this means i suppose
that you dont despise yourself as much as you just dont care for you because
we can often project our own selfbeliefs onto others this is an abstract
concept that will take some time to get used to but i have a suspicion that
with just a little more selfcare and a little more caring for others you
might be better off very soon"
1093,am i going to be alone forever,i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,selfesteem,im glad youre aware of how you honestly feel  knowing ones personal truth is always the first step in finding what is necessary to be and developreflect a little more on the type of care youd like in your lifecare means anything from checking in on someone to deep intimate connection between two peopleknowing your own definition of care is the first step to know what is necessary for you to recognize what youd like attractingit is much easier to attract what wed like if we are clear on what this is
1094,am i going to be alone forever,i feel like im trying to convince myself that im okay when im not im always blocking out the bad things and forgetting i also feel like nobody cares for me and they never will i feel truly alone,selfesteem,as social creatures we humans all long for deep human connection to know that we belong and are part of something larger it is so important to us that when we feel alone  it can feel almost unbearable you are not alone in feeling alone while it can take time to build deep relationships there are moments in each day where we have the opportunity to interact with other people who may also feel lonely and scared and want to be seen and acknowledged i wonder what it might be like for you if you took on an experiment of trying to really see the people around you and make little attempts to acknowledge and connect with them  fellow humans on this journey of life a good morning at the bus stop or really looking at the person who you buy your groceries from or thanking or complimenting someone for something that you notice and appreciate while this is not a substitute for close relationships these moments of real connection with the people who we share our communities with can go a long way to realizing that we are not as alone as we may have thought
1095,i cant focus when im doing work even when i try to force myself to do it,i feel so irritated and frustrated because of it i get so angry to the point that i feel like im going to explode i feel pathetic stupid and worthless i just cant take this anymore,selfesteem,yeah i get the same problem look im not a professional but ive heard a few things a powernap can help just a half hour of sleep can clear your mind and let you refocus also brain activity increases with physical exertion just walk around for a minute and get your brain working and thatll help you reach the task at hand taking breaks it totally okay try to have something to do in between that you enjoy
1096,why do i keep letting myself get cheated on,ive been with the mother of my child for years,selfesteem,i would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better  i would suggest that you get to know yourself   what do you need in a relationship  what is holding you to this relationship other than your child  what have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect  just a few questions to ask yourself
1097,how do i cope or motivate myself without pain,when im not cutting im drinking when i try healthy outlets such as exercise i end up running myself down into an asthma attack from weapons to words i cant help but self harm what am i supposed to do how do i stop this cycle i dont know how else to cope or motivate myself without pain,selfesteem,it sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control you are concerned about your behavior and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it in working with a therapist you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors develop strategies for taking care of yourself and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic self
1098,why am i so angry and jealous,im in my late s and ive never had a boyfriend or even been on a date i have no friends i hate facebook because everyone else has kids and a great husband and great paying jobs i work in retail and i cant find a job i have an associate degree no one is not giving me a chance and im getting upset and frustrated i feel worthless and feel like everyone hates me i feel like a failure and i still live with my dad its very embarrassing,selfesteem,in case knowing this helps you there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realizesimilar to you they are not on fb for the reasons you list  plus no one wants to go on fb and tell the world they dont have a fantastic life  everyone on fb is happy even when theyre miserable theyre happy telling everyone about itfirst yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living  please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have is not necessarily the true life they are having  ive been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age  start having problems by their midthirtiessecond respect your unique identity  for whatever reason you have more sensitivity possibly more depth more complex standards and expectations of yourself and othersas hard as it may sound or actually be take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you you need for your own growth and developmentfeeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive  consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goalsi hope this helps
1099,i like a guy but i worry that he thinks im creepy,,selfesteem,he may also think youre the most wonderful person in the world and that hes glad to know youworrying what someone else thinks about us without directly approaching them in an open minded way to see what actually are their impressions of us will wear out the person who has the worryfeeling nervous and to a degree anxious is pretty typical of anyone   since until you find out whether this particular guy likes you or does not like you the possibility of an unfavorable outcome creates anxiousnessthe best way out of your anxiety is to decide on your way of being friendly to this guy and see how he handles himselfwho knows you may end up being the one who thinks he is creepygood luck
1100,how come i feel ugly,im in my early s ive been married once and he cheated on me ever since then ive felt ugly no matter what im engaged and i still feel ugly i dont like to take pictures of myself,selfesteem,sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husbandhe did an ugly action and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling itdoes this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incidentyou may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt  it is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until nowas you address all the emotional pain youve lived through the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own because youd be focused on you not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband
1101,how can i be sure that im not choosing my relationship out of fear of being alone,im scared that i am with this man so i wont be alone he should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case and i dont want to hurt him,selfesteem,while not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think  since you seem to care about your friend dont want to hurt him i imagine there are many other reasons that you are together  i suggest that you talk about this openheartedly with each other  the idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place  dont try to figure out whether you should be with him  just talk  the communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for both of youin the meantime your idea that you dont deserve him is rooted in a core lie that you are telling yourself  you can read about core lies and much more in my book living yes a handbook for being human  check out wwwlivingyesorgbe easy on yourself  you are deservingmark
1102,im desperate for attention and i dont know what to do about it,i like getting attention from men i dont have sex i lead them on to thinking i might want to i like to tease i like for men to chase me and i like to feel wanted,selfesteem,hi michigan good for you for recognising a destructive pattern this behaviour although it might get you the attention you want initially will ultimately drive men away because its not respectful of them my gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone thats a powerful thought you are certainly acting as if this is true if you believed in your value as a person you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general if i were your therapist id have many questions for you and i would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from id suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour good luck
1103,i feel like im this dumb fat girl that no one likes and everything is my fault are these normal teenage girl feelings,everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it everyone around me is skinny and here i am trying to throw up so im not fat everything i do is wrong and i cant seem to do anything right no one else at school seems to feel the way i do is this normal teenage girls feelings i dont think these feelings are normal,selfesteem,there are some struggles that are less obvious than others an eating disorder being one of them from just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you in the same way there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice so you are definitely not alone low selfesteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that every teen in fact every person has experienced at some point these feelings are normal it sounds though as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today  comparing yourself to others purging and feeling extreme guilt sometimes its best if we seek outside help instead of trying to tackle problems on our own breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor nutritionist and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out hope this helps

1112,how can i be more confident around girls,i keep hearing i am attractive from people around me and i think i believe it but i have low confidence regarding approaching girls i like,selfesteem,i recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs that are going through your mind at the time in which you are trying to approach a girl when you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs you can then work on changing them an easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words must or never once you recognize the thought or belief i would like you to picture a big red stop sign this is called thought stopping this is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts then i would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as negative thought that girl will never go out with me stop positive thought i wont know if she will go out with me unless i ask what this does is increase your self confidence by replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones that will ultimately boost your self esteem
1113,im a  year old male with low self esteem ive always been very closed off about my feelings and problems,a few nights ago i talked to this girl i know about my self esteem issues for the first time we talked for hours and she told me time and again that i was a great guy she told me i was attractive and have a great personality etc i really started to feel better about myself by the time i woke up the next morning now though i cant stop thinking about her but i leave to go back to college in a few days and i go to school  hours away from her so now i feel constantly depressed because even if i told her how i felt it wouldnt matter i feel helpless and i dont know what to do,selfesteem,hey  it takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone  and it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings  a big part of the process however of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend  leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness  try this  make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself  ask your friends and family to contribute to the list  then carry it with you in your wallet  and when you need a selfesteem boost take a look at it  you are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities  reach out to your longdistance friend when you need support  and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer  be wise
1114,should i end it,how do i decide if i should end my relationship with my boyfriend,relationshipdissolution,previous counselors have discussed very good points about your situation so i would like just to confirm what seems essential to me on this topic when you ask yourself this question it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far relationships require time and work for them to develop grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners this is a key factor reciprocity without both of you sharing the same core values beliefs expectations and lifestyles without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood protected cared by supported and loved by each other there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long run what has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run many people focus too much on looks financial benefits or other external factors which are important but cannot build a healthy mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship this does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities what they ignore is that with time life challenges issues and pain temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly undermined be honest with yourself reflect on what you truly need want and expect from a boyfriend and life partner ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you so while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner the other could feel frustrated or just not truly fulfilled passionate or happy with herhis partner longterm relationships require a lot and when i talk about sharing same core factors i mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical mental emotional and spiritual levels and around all the other roles life  involves related to lifestyle as social life habits dreams preferences etcthen there is a lot to reflect on by yourself to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person if you feel you do then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way in a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that as another counselor suggested out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work if your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthy many people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone by themselves thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives to bring some feelings of happiness and company the problem is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling unless the person works on herselfhimself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationship finally i want to mention what i shared in a past article on this subject namely you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions otherwise lack of honesty accountability andor respect would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships also we are all human beings and that means we are no perfect and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves without manipulation neglect or abuse thus while on one hand healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses on the other hand it is fully incompatible with tolerating andor enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves this is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary without this it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time they would not they would just get worse so lets take one step at a time reflect on what you feel need and want now and for the future assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better if professional support is needed and both are willing to take it please do not delay it if one refuses necessary support then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you trust more actions than words set and keep healthy boundaries and take into account what life experiences show you as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial biased or too rushedthank you for sharing

1204,im not sure if i want to trust my husband again,my husband used a lot of negative words to hurt me and i moved out he is seeing a counselor and wants another chance to make things right im not sure if i trust that he will not go back to his old ways,relationshipdissolution,i am glad he is seeing a counselor  that is something that most men struggle with doing at times  time will tell if his actions are of good intentions  however remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships   what part did you play  did you down play his disrespect at one time  did you give up the power of your own voice  did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided  did you allow him to make you doubt yourself   in others words if you do decide to give him another chance what would you do different  not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words at all but dont allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future  if you do decide to give it another try go in with a voice with the demand of respect with your needs and wants expressed and expected  with an increase in your self worth and confidence you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions   seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self
1205,why do i still feel a connection with my exboyfriend that hurt me very badly,my exboyfriend boyfriend and i lived together he had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her one was an abortion another was a miscarriage and then she had the third baby they are not together but he continues to contact me and wants me back he has nothing to offer me,relationshipdissolution,hi atticathis is a question i think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them in your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you for some people honestly its a game to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you if you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour remind yourself why you dont want to be with them i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me thats great selftalkbut lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this sometimes its because we still hope they will change maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days the problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less so what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of people do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life this is a normal but not a healthy thought its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes you deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused if you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better it will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursdraw a line their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance

1214,why do i feel like im always wrong in everything in my relationship,my wife is always accusing me of cheating and telling me that im doing things she finds disrespectful even when i dont mean it like that for example she gets offended when i call someone at work sweetheart i wish i had a penny for every time she accused me of cheating on her she doesnt and never will say she was wrong how do i get her to understand,workplacerelationships,hello that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story i would say that you are raising  different concerns one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified it may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said  if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsthe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of im sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says im sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating for more information about these services you are welcome to read my materials on my website at wwwpsychologyresourceca or

1219,how can i cope with work related stress better,"i am in a high stress position for a tech company i am being overworked and underpaid for my contributions and it is not only giving me anxiety but also demoralizing
   what can i do to manage my stress",workplacerelationships,i think its important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress it is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid you will not perform well as you mention and thus your selfesteem will continually take a hit without really any effort so i dont know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first stepyou dont speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better because we exist as a part of a relationship with everything including people at our job i would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss often overworked and underpaid also includes the my boss never notices me and that can demoralizing if we feel appreciated that can go a long way ive found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees appreciation and it goes deeper than thank you or taking you out to lunch  its almost something felt as opposed to made explicitbut sometimes appreciation isnt going to do the trick either because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel burnout you have zero interest in doing the job in the way it is designed so some real changes need to be implemented the bottom line try not to just suck it up and do all of the self care work on your own if your company isnt helping you to take care of yourself im talking to you boss that handles employee pay andor work conditions then you also have to question if this is a company worth working for while i dont know exactly what you do it sounds like you have confidence in your contributions so take that confidence to a tech company that will support you and there are tech companies out there

1248,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,as in matthew    ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you although i minister in interfaith  jesus also mentions about how he lives within all of us  as in the beginning when the solar system was created in dark matter   we are created in the image of to better understand ourselves  your soul journey the date and time life  breathed into your physical part while understand that we animate the physical  faith and belief is a choice  suggestion  order a life path report  it helps you learn more about you educate and seek spiritual advisors to help you connect to the spirit   talking about it helps
1249,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,since no one can prove that there is a higher power meaning we cannot observe god with our senses the decision to believe is a choice you make  when something cant be proven true you get to choose what belief system works best for you  some questions to reflect on might be  what does god even mean  what are the experiences that have shaped your perception of god  are there any other ways to think of it what turns you on or off to the idea of god  and remember that there is a difference between religion and spirituality  you do not have to be religious to believe in god how might your life look if you truly believed there was a higher powergod  how might that be beneficial  why wouldnt you believe what is there to lose how might your life look if you chose not to believe in any higher power  is there anything you might lose  what would you gain how do you cope with things that are outside of your control and dont make sense  how do you cope with the idea of death and tragedyif you decide that you would like to cultivate a belief in god then there are ways you can strengthen this belief some doubt and questioning is always normal  something you could do to strengthen your belief is to look for ways that it fits into your life  look for things that have happened in your life that show you there is somethingsomeone out there looking out for you  another way to think about god is to think about love  not in the emotional sense of the word but in terms of good versus evil light versus dark love versus hate  there are some things out there that are clearly evil acts christians refer to this as the enemy and sin but many times something good can be found amidst the bad  as fred rogers once said whenever you see something terrible that happened on the news look for the helpers  you will always find people who are helping  and as one of my favorite verses from the bible goes light always overcomes darknessremember the answers youre looking for come from within  just look for the answers you hope to find and they will come to you
1250,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,there are an infinite number of ways to look at this spirituality religion god higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people my question for you is what does real actually mean to you often the concept of god has to do with what you believe in if you ask  different people youll probably get almost that many different answersconsider talking with friends or family about this i would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do you may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure the local salvation army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services there may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussionjust a word of caution in my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others when initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinionsas far as whether god is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process
1251,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,thanks for posting  this is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless among other emotions due to the uncertainty  you said that at times you feel like everyone is lying ask yourself some of these questions  what is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying  where is the concrete evidence that they are lying how could i test my thoughts about this what if things are not what they seem on the surface am i any lesser of a person as a result of this persons behavior or opinion  our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world  and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave  it is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions  you can start this process by answering some of the above questions  we are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with  as it pertains to if god is a lie be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that god is or is not real  it may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that  hope this helps at least a little bit
1252,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,the way that i see it is that humans have always been afraid of life and death historically we have always tried to understand life we try to organize it categorize it explore it and weve built up this system our system and societies system around us to help us define what life and death is this system or way is not real but only a perception of our own value judgements it is no matter how you try to argue it a false system of conditioning humans have a finite mind and a finite mind cannot ever hope to understand an infinite mind of which a god would be god has been developed over time as a security blanket for our childlike selves the world is a beautifully brutal place and what is more reassuring than a master that will take care of us and show us the way on earth alone there are thousands of gods and even many more systems of thought economics societal structures and so on it is almost as though it were a supermarket with so many choices we have more choices in gods than we do flavors of ice cream at baskinrobbins so then i ask you which one is real and what is real
1253,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,it is not a stupid question it is very basic to help answer your question let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof with that being said one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly if one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable then there must be a guiding force and plan  may you be successful in your journey
1254,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,your question is actually thoughtful and reflects a true interest to know more about lifeno one knows if god is a lie because god is a concept in which people either make up their own definition of this concept or believe one of the concepts of what god is handed down by religionsall the religions exclude the other god concepts and expect loyalty to believing in their particular version of godprobably god is real in the sense that most people want to believe there is guided purpose to what goes on in lifethis is as definite as what we can know about godgod is not a lie because it is not a fact  beliefs arent provable
1255,im struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,maybe this is a stupid question but i sometimes dont know whats real or not if feel at times like everyones lying how do i know if god is one of those lies,spirituality,believing in god is a matter of faith  there are many opinions out there for and against gods existence  but the real question is not if god is real or not but do you want to have faith and decide that he exists  this is a personal choice  reading scripture may help to learn more about those who struggle with believing but again you decide if you believe that scripture is true or not   praying and asking for a revelation or a confirmation may help as well but again it is another act of faith estoy teniendo dificultad con la idea de dios es real o notal vez es una pregunta estúpida pero algunas veces no sé que es real o no  siento que todo el mundo miente cómo se si dios es una de esas mentirascreer en dios es una cuestión de fe  hay muchas opiniones en favor y en contra de la existencia de dios  pero la verdadera pregunta no es si dios existe pero si tu quieres creer que existe  esto es una decisión muy individual  leer la biblia te puede ayudar a conocer sobre algunas personas que han dudado pero de nuevo tu decides si las escrituras son reales para ti orar y pedir una revelación o confirmación es otro acto de fe que te puede ayudar

there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal
river the current of the river swept silently over them all  young and
old rich and poor good and evil  the current going its own way knowing
only its own crystal self
each creature in its own
manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging
was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned
from birth
but one creature said
at last i am tired of clinging though i cannot see it with my eyes
i trust that the current knows where it is going i shall let go and let
it take me where it will clinging i shall die of boredom
the other creatures laughed
and said fool let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled
and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredom
but the one heeded them
not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed
by the current across the rocks
yet in time as the creature
refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and
he was bruised and hurt no more
and the creatures downstream
to whom he was a stranger cried see a miracle a creature like ourselves
yet he flies see the messiah come to save us all
and the one carried in
the current said i am no more messiah than you the river delights to
lift us free if only we dare let go our true work is this voyage this
adventure
but they cried the more
savior all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again
he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a savior"

1273,i want to be a boy but i cant because of my religion,i was born a girl but i want to be a boy because of my religion i cant tell my family i know they wont accept me what do i do,spirituality,"i understand that this must be a difficult time for you with
many adjustments if you feel comfortable enough to ask your parents to see a
life coach or a therapist this may be an excellent place to start you dont
need to tell them the reason why maybe say that you simply need someone to talk
to for support with school or homework etc the life coach or therapist would
be the optimal person to advise you on how to proceed with providing support
and guidance there may be someone at your school whom you could talk to for
confidential support and guidance as well be confident in the fact that you
are not alone and there are always responsible adults available to guide you
through any difficult process you may experience in life talking to family
about personal issues can be difficult for anyone even adults i recommend
getting help from a trusted professional adult before you decide what to do"

1280,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,what exactly is it that you are looking for different people define themselves in different ways for example one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics still another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience at the same time who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have this may help you to know more about what you value what you like and dislike and what you want for yourself in life best of luck to you
1281,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,this is perhaps the deepest question that one can ask of themselves and the answer is as elusive as the deepest enigma we are fluid beings we are never the same from day to day we learn or unlearn we evolve or some of us even devolve we are in a state of constant flux changing and adapting like a cloud in the sky that has its shape changed by the wind life whittles us away and carves us constantly trying to understand this question is like trying to bite your own teeth however we can have a sense of what we would call our core and to understand the core we need to live and to experience but also to think deeply analytically and critically by engaging with life we get a sense that we are like the earth itself inside of us there is a core just as there is inside our planet but our continents shift and change over time like those continents so does our own nature shift throughout our lives
1282,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,because you put this under the category of spirituality im not sure whether you are asking how you find yourself as far as religious or spiritual beliefs or overallif you are talking about learning more about religious or spirituality consider either going to or speaking with someone who is involved with a nondenominational church service the salvation army usually has something so you can discuss questions or ideas that you may haveas far as finding yourself in general i suggest considering what makes you happy andor comfortable i also wonder if looking at the list of values here may be helpful to you httpwwwtherapistaidcomtherapyworksheetvaluesclarification

1284,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,the older i get the more i believe that our real task isnt to find ourselves were already  there what we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive most happy most creative and most fully engaged with life it is in those moments that we find ourselvesfor example i couldnt help loving the people or things i loved no matter who tried to talk me out of them all i needed to do was notice when my heart opened and i felt the most alivenot because i was afraid or addicted but because in those moments i was in contact with my highest self on the flip side i needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in methe ones that made me feel controlled constricted dishonest resentful or afraidand be honest about them mindfulness of what already is is the key to finding yourself align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you dont let old habits crappy jobs or meanspirited people define you just stumble your way forward as best you can with greater selfawareness followed by affirmative action
1285,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,three years ago i attended a week long meditation retreat by the fifth day i noticed i was light headed and felt very strange i began to realize within my own being an experience of no separation i would see others at the retreat and smile i loved them all i could feel the connection with this awareness i had read about but never truly understood until that moment i remember understanding all the teachings i had learned throughout my life about a god who existed outside of me i realized i had all these answeres within my own being and so did everyone else i began to see everyone as not just capable but powerful loving beings since this experience it has been my desire for everyone to become conscious within whatever experience they wish i do this in many ways at our studio we combine mental health with yoga and meditation as well as nutrition counseling to help people come to their optimal selves to truly come into a state of finding yourself is to start to know and own who you are from a state of solid being in this there is nothing new under the sun and it is very simple i would love to teach you and anyone interested in coming into a state of awake conciousness  the more awake we are the more joyful we are i live in this state of being and demonstrate it in my daily life

1287,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,start by giving yourself enough quiet and time to remember about yourself what feels steady and consistent in your nature and interactions with othersgive yourself the freedom to your interest in having interests  are you motivated because of competing with others or because an activity itself feels satisfyingif you are able to develop a sense of defining yourself without fear of judging yourself you will start coming close to knowing who you are
1288,how do i find myself,i dont know what to say i have never really known who i am,spirituality,im having the same issue i think you need to consider your morals and what you really want out of life if theres something you want to achieve thats who you are and you need to put yourself into that and immerse yourself in the purpose of whatever you want it doesnt matter how small it may seem if theres nothing you want badly then think about other things what others want or what you need or what others need find something that feels important and commit to it
1289,how do i cope with losing my mom,,spirituality,im so sorry you lost your mom  grief is a tough process  usually the pain from loss doesnt go away but changes in ways that are manageable for your life  when most people lose someone others offer a lot of support  after a while that support tapers off even though your need for support doesnt  its important to identify people or resources that can be there for you when you are still hurting  do you have anyone in your life that is pretty constant  there are also many grief support groups online eg httpswwwgriefshareorg and are usually some in person depending on your area  these may be temporarily discontinued due to the covid situation though they may be doing these groups online as a way to offset the social distancing requirementsi know nothing about what your relationship with your mom was the manner in which she passed or how old you are but many times that can come with some pretty complicated emotions  i also dont know if you lost your mom through deathsome people lose a parent via abandonment or a disease such as dementia  no matter what the situation is whatever pain shows up for you is completely ok  many people feel much more than sadness especially if the relationship with their loved one was problematic or if the loss was unexpected or traumatic  its normal to feel intense anger guilt feelings of disbelief even happiness or relief  grief does not have the same path for everyone and whatever path you are on is not wrongwhen i work with a client that has had a significant loss there are a number of things i may work on with them  one is letter writing  this isnt for everybody and some people need support and guidance with this  sometimes there are things we feel have been unsaid and it can provide a sense of closure  for some people it helps feel connected to that person again  closure is not necessary to be able to move through grief but it can be helpful  if the client feels it would be useful we also try to find a way to honor that person  that may be through talking about them having a monthly or yearly ritual or carrying on a tradition they enjoyed  it also depends on the culture you come from as well  many different cultures have different beliefs about death and loss and the ways they think of or honor their loved one  stick with what you feel speaks to your heartof course a counselor who specializes in grief may be a great option  you can find someone in your area or online in your specific state that has the training for that  counselors without that specialization may also be able to provide you some helpi dont know any counselors who havent had training in this area  counselors are usually happy to answer your questions about their qualificationsi hope this helps you find some support

   one day my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages as soon as my dad found this out he told my mom they were both aggravated they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants they said he wanted me for sex and hes not a christian i took their advice and broke up with him once we broke up for about a month i decided to get back together with him a little after school started my parents found out eventually and i decided to not listen this time i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him hows hes not the right one for me and god totally forbids him i would kind of try to break up with him and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents theyre always yelling at me about how i shouldnt date this boy i felt too old to listen to them now im kind of just stuck is the real me religious have i been brainwashed by him i dont talk to my parents anymore about him and my parents think im deceiving because of it they threatened me that if im still with him i cant do track and they wont support me theyve also called me slut and now they called me basically a devil worshipper they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents im actually very happy with him they also say im living a separate life at home than i am at school they say they want whats best for me and love me because they adopted me",spirituality,what a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you i would say the first thing you want to do is if you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward you unfortunately will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents it always helps to try and see things from another angle you might want to for example try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively are you living with your parents and do they support you if so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that best of luck to you
1293,my son and family has different views about religion how do i resolve these differences,in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs,spirituality,i think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction there are many families that are united despite their differences for example a mother may be catholic and the father jewish by introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial also its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences so dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential
1294,my son and family has different views about religion how do i resolve these differences,in particular during family gatherings such as funerals where there are different customs,spirituality,you have an opportunity but you havent described a problem  are you creating one  many families have various members who have different spiritual beliefs and religious practices  accepting the idea that those with whom we are close may be different from us is the only way to create a world of peace   this may be a wonderful opportunity to practice tolerance and love  if mutual decisions need to be made in religious contexts you may also get to practice boundary setting assertiveness without aggression communication skills and loving kindness  this is a great problem to work through  it is indeed a very spiritual question  blessings to you all mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg

   how can i get my life back",trauma,im so sorry that you have been haunted by the past for so long  it must have been incredibly difficult to open up about something so dark and vulnerable  but by shedding light on it you have already taken the first step toward healing  trauma can wreak havoc on relationships if it isnt healed  in fact we are all reacting to things every day based on perceptions colored by our past experiences  the good news is you can heal by gaining an understanding of how trauma from the past is affecting you now developing healthy coping skills and working through those memories and emotions with a therapist  this will require some rewiring of the brain meaning that you will identify the negative thought patterns and beliefs and replace them with something more helpful  for example if your negative reaction feels like im abandoned and alone you might work on changing it to i can get my needs met and ill be okay regardless or if you find yourself feeling like im not worthy of love you might change that to something like i deserve to be lovedmost likely the reason youre pushing this man away is because something about this relationship is triggering negative beliefs and emotions from the past and your reaction by pushing him away protects you in some way even though there may not be any real danger now  you probably know this logically but trauma gets stuck in our emotional mind which you cant reason with  thats why you have to work through the emotions to be able to see things more clearly from a new and more helpful perspective  i like to think of emotions like clouds that block the sun and make it difficult to see anything clearly  if we ignore and avoid the clouds all the time then we will spend our lives looking at the ground  if you can learn to safely weather the storm  youll find that before long it will pass and youll be able to see things clearly againi recommend working with a therapist who is trained in treating trauma and who you feel comfortable with because they will be able to tailor treatment to your specific needs  you can have the happy life and healthy relationship you desire and deserve

   how can i get my life back",trauma,im going to second that it is completely brave of you to share something you kept hidden for over  years  thats a huge dealsomething awesome about the brain is that it can learn at any time in the human lifespan  no matter how long you have dealt with the affects of trauma your brain has potential to rewire and change how it operates  this is just my assumption but it sounds like you are just realizing the impact the trauma has had and is continuing to have on your life  first of all thats phenomenal informationmany people spend their lives blind to these influences and may never get help  on the other hand it can be super overwhelming to now have all this insight about yourself and not know how to deal with it  its ok to feel that uncertainty andor stress about the processthats totally expected and will most likely feel less powerful the more you move through healingi understand your fears about pushing away someone you care about and that seems important to you  thats quite a normal behavior as a result of childhood trauma  when we are first learning our relationship to others and the world as children trauma can teach us that others are unsafe or may hurt us  almost all my clients have experienced childhood trauma and one of the things we spend time exploring is what they may be trying to protect themselves from by pushing others away  vulnerability can be scary for everybody but why specifically is it scary for you  i bet theres a really logical reasonits unclear how long youve known this man and how connected you feel to him but could he potentially be a support person for you  if you feel uncomfortable with that that doesnt mean anything bad  it just means you arent ready  its not easy to talk about such hard things  it does seem like you know that you behave in ways that push him awaywhat would your behavior look like if you didnt  that doesnt mean sharing everything or no boundaries but meeting him somewhere in the middle  sometimes the brain needs evidence that being vulnerable doesnt always equate to danger or rejectionas others have noted a counselor can help if you so choose to go that route  i cant say what your journey will look like but i already have so much hope for you since you are obviously incredibly courageous and motivated to work to make your life better  if  year old you can make it through trauma then  year old you can definitely work through this

1328,is it possible for a person to stop feeling emotions,i was raped a couple months ago since then along with other unfortunately events that have occurred i have been having trouble feeling emotions its almost as if im a sociopath lacking any feeling what can i do to change this,trauma,i am so sorry this has happened to you i hope you have some people you find emotionally supportive around you in terms of your question i understand what you are talking about sometimes when a person experiences a traumatic event an event called dissociation occurs dissociation is the brains way of temporary creating and increasing  emotional distance between what is happening and what you are feeling and experiencing this is a kind of natural coping mechanism and it can occur just prior to during and after an event has occurred people describe the feeling as being numb or detached from others their surroundings and even from their own body all of these descriptions are accurate and they are your brains attempt to try and keep you safe from emotions that may otherwise overwhelm you this is good in the shortterm because you are not having to immediately face and cope with the immensely painful feelings associated with your trauma but it is also notsogood in that it also blocks your ability to feel positive and pleasurable emotions so while your brain is protecting you it is also preventing feelings you need now more than ever such as regaining a sense of safety soothing your hurts and feeling empowered for your survivalyou are not a sociopath so do not worry about that but i would strongly recommend that you consider seeing a therapist or other supportive mental health professional to help you work through what is happened there are ways for you to heal from your experience which will help you get back to a place where you can feel safe enough to feel again  it might be an uncomfortable journey at times but you are already hurting and your life is being negatively impacted now good therapy sometimes is like pulling out a splinterit may hurt a bit to dig that sucker out but once its out your body can finally start to heal  it might seem better and less painful to leave it alone and ignore avoid it but you risk infection by your inaction which will be  x worse than just digging it out best of luck to youlearn more about me and my practice at wwwemdrhealscom

1343,i have nightmares and flashbacks about a past relationship,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,trauma,ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse  if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true this negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship  the fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse  good for younightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories including associated beliefs emotions and physical sensations that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed  there are likely reminders called triggers of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences  this is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you  however you likely feel as if you are not in control    the goal is protect your current relationship evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings and begin working on healing your memories of abuse in many cases my use of emdr eye movement desensitization and reprocessing would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories reduce or eliminate triggers bring healing and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship  i would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences your decision to pursue counseling and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship  with a good support network in place healing is very possible

1347,i have nightmares and flashbacks about a past relationship,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,trauma,one thing you could try to do on your own is to focus on the partner who is in front of you now if you are able to connect with them via touch or focusing on their tone of voice that may help to center you tried to stay grounded andor mindful that is being aware of your position in the room your feet on the floor your hands in your lap or your hips in the chair being mindful of the environment you are currently for example noticing what is around you may be helpful try to use all your senses for example you could focus on hearing your husbands voice feeling his hand in yours being wrapped in your favorite blanket seeing a comforting photo using a comforting sense or candle or tasting an apple that reminds you of times when you have enjoyed yourself in the kitchenit also sounds like you are having a very specific reaction that could very well be related to trauma i would recommend that you talk with a local mental health professionalremember just because it was the best decision of your life that doesnt mean that what happened to you or in your presence automatically leaves you when you leave the relationship our brain is actually hardwired to remember things that have caused us pain or great emotional distress as a way of protecting us from them happening again this is a very natural response and the reactions you have as far as nightmares and flashbacks are the past coming forward and your brain trying to make sense of it all

1349,i have nightmares and flashbacks about a past relationship,i was the one who ended it and im so glad i did it was the best decision i made in my life but how do i stop the nightmares and flashbacks it is creating a wall in my current relationship,trauma,a lot of times when youre experiencing nightmares and flashbacks it can be a sign that you havent fully processed what happened our brains tend to replay scenes in our life that we wish had turned out differently or  in an effort to desensitize us to it  if you are comfortable with it you may want to consider sharing what youre experiencing with your current partner so that he is able to understand whats going on also you may want to consider  what parts of your past relationship you blame yourself for this can be a difficult task to undertake on your own and the help of the therapist may be necessary to sort through the memories in a safe way  typically however flashbacks and nightmares are a sign that the trauma  of what you went through needs to be addressed  its a great thing that you were able to have the courage to get out of that relationship and you should be proud of yourself for that  you may want to  begin therapy to address these traumatic memories and help you to sort through any conflicting emotions you have about it ie  feeling like its your fault for not recognizing the abuse or getting out of the relationship sooner blaming yourself for being   the kind of person who gets into an abusive relationship   or believing that you somehow caused your ex to abuse you in some way  these types of beliefs and feelings can prevent us from moving past traumatic experiences and a trained therapist can certainly help you sort through them

1351,my girlfriend cant stand it when i touch her,my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on,trauma,was your gf always this way with you or did her withdrawal develop suddenlyalso are there any other changes going on between the two of you in terms of feeling relaxed and at ease with each other enjoying each otherits possible her physical withdrawal due to her sensitive nature about who touches her and the meaning of touch reflects an underlying emotional hesitation about her feelings toward youthis can be either strong positive or negative feelingsshe may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you and withdrawsshe may be actually withdrawing and expresses herself through the amount of touch she wants from othersbest way forward as almost always in a relationship is to have a gentle conversation to open up the tension between the two of you
1352,my girlfriend cant stand it when i touch her,my girlfriend was abused as a child now if i hug or touch her in any kind of way she says she feels as if she is being abused as a child what might be going on,trauma,sounds like she might be triggered and having a trauma response this is normal for folks whove experienced trauma the part of our brains that detects danger acts like a smoke alarm in our house its constantly scanning for threats and makes a bunch of noise if it detects one smoke alarms cant distinguish between smokey bacon cooking or an actual house fire  they just detect a threat and alert everyone of it our brain is similar her brain has probably learned that physical touch is dangerous for her so whatever response she has next is her brains way of trying to protect her particularly with sexual trauma this can be a really frustrating experience for romantic partners trying to connect physically or sexually

1354,should we put off kids until my husband is mentally cured,my boyfriend is seeking therapy he is in his s and has some childhood issues he has kids from his previous exwife and is unable to see them,trauma,probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsdont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured  a relatively qualified therapist would never make this callpsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families  you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenchildhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeif the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting

1358,what is the best way to cope with the loss of someone to suicide,i recently lost a friend to suicide im smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it how can i handle this better,trauma,im so sorry to hear about your recent loss  there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and its never easy  i think its important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else  the fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time  marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions when it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty  the more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours the more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss in talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level writing a poem planting a tree etc or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc we never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us nowbut that also takes time

1365,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,you are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative  it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiencesif you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers  the vet center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma heres a link to a directory of vet centershttpwwwvagovdirectoryguidevetcenteraspyour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated
1366,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,the short answer is yes with a maybe tagged on the end let me explain  first off thank you for serving our country the vast majority of the population will never understand the sorts of experiences that military members have encountered and we know that veterans suffer from ptsd at higher percentages than civilians we also know that motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of ptsd my friend youve been struggling it seems so it can be helpful to think of ptsd symptoms like a wave or a series of waves sometimes the waves are larger and last for longer and sometimes theyre easier to manage one of the most common ways for ptsd waves to be more challenging is due to something we call avoidance we avoid both internal things thinking about the trauma avoiding unpleasant emotions etc but also external reminders perhaps driving in a car being in crowds being around loud noises people standing behind you etc and the more we push that stuff away the longer those waves stick around therefore trauma therapy usually involves confronting that avoidance in safe and protected ways to try to reteach your brain that even through something might feel upsetting it doesnt mean that youre actually in danger let me give you an example lets say you avoid being in a crowd your ptsd wants to convince you that all crowds are dangerous and between you and me we both know that there are some crowds that are absolutely dangerous if youre in a biker bar where people are smoking meth and throwing knives at dartboardsthats probably a pretty dangerous place to be but maybe you dont hang out in biker bars maybe youre just trying to pick up your milk and eggs at the grocery store when your crowdavoidance kicks in well those two environments are very different could something dangerous happen in the grocery store yes is it likely that youre in danger probably not and so if youve worked through the ptsd from the military but then go through a car accident it might be that some of those old avoidant patterns are popping back up the good news however is that there are several different options through the va vet center or private counseling that can help look for whats called an evidencebased approach these are things like cognitive processing therapy prolonged exposure therapy written exposure therapy or eye movement desensitization reprocessing your counselor can help you decide which might be the best approach for you ptsd is very treatable you dont have to suffer reach out to a qualified therapist
1367,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,it depends on what you mean by problems however a therapist who specializes in ptsd i can say it wouldnt be uncommon to see an increase in ptsd symptoms or severity after something like a car accident it is just adding trauma onto trauma sort of like kicking you when you are down your body may not have the same resources to handle the car accident as it did at other times in your life hopefully that makes sense
1368,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,a car accident can be scary and possibly trigger your symptoms of ptsd it is good that you recognize the possibility of this occurringnot everyone who experiences a car accident develops ptsd the chances are definitely increased due to your prior diagnosis during military servicesome of the things to be mindful of for yourself include feelings of anxiety and increased heart rate when youre faced with reminders of the event feeling a little more on edge when youre drivingbeing more watchful youre more likely to scan your environment for potential sources of threats avoidance because of the anxiety that often follows an accident its natural that you may want to avoid some situations or experience hesitation at timesif you experience any of these symptoms or feel other symptoms of ptsd it would be advisable to seek help possibly through your local va medical clinic or a private practitioner there are certain modalities such as emdr that can help with your symptoms
1369,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,there are many types of traumas and they certainly can compound on one another as you experience them without treating the traumas or incidents where you felt there was a significant risk to your safety or that of others there can be a cumulative effect what we have learned in the mental health field from studying traumas is that the body as a whole responds to these stressors in order to keep you safe during the events if the body does not realize that it no longer needs to respond in this way because the event is now over and then receives a trigger from a new event it makes sense that the new event could cause additional issues both of these events can be addressed with the help of a counselor there are many counselors that specialize in trauma inside and outside of the va so shop around if you are able and find someone that you connect with
1370,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,a car accident can be a traumatic event especially  if it was serious you could have feared for your life felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards this may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military if it is then it is possible that you will see a direct effect in triggering off ptsd symptoms even if it didnt it is possible that the complexity of the two situations will interact inside you to be a combined response having already been diagnosed with ptsd this might be a good time to reconnect with the help system you had around military experiences and explore it a little bit about the new experience the right exploration does not have to make things worse and can be a good source of prevention
1371,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,i have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder due to my military experiences not a year ago i had a car accident could this experience add more problems,trauma,post traumatic stress disorder can occur after any traumatic event where a real and present threat of harm or loss of life to yourself or others is present yes a car accident could increase ptsd symptoms such as hypervigilance anxiety nightmares replaying the event etc depending on the severity of the accident new triggers might exist this is not to say that you cannot recover are you currently experiencing additional trauma symptoms

1410,my husband treats me terribly,my husband and i have been together for seven years now i will be honest i have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff i recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because i was afraid to tell him what happened ever since then he gives me the cold shoulder he gets so mad and ignores me for days hes really verbally and emotionally abusive he tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names should we call it quits im tired of crying but we have a toddler together,domesticviolence,hi texas thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask should we call it quits we i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together the way your husband treats you is not your fault texas your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you the problem is not your lying the problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trusttheres an analogy that i sometimes use i dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but its powerful either way so i will tell it to youif you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die if you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying it has lost its strength its called learned helplessness when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you you have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child in my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse this is a complex picture and if you were my client i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child i sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist i wish you the best
1411,is it possible to gain joy and prosperity in my relationship after years of unhappiness,my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now throughout the entire first day that we met he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another that same night he and a friend stayed over at my house without my moms acknowledgment and we kissed the next two days were a repetition of the first day on the third night my mother finally caught us and i was kicked out of my house i left with him of course and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple it was very hard for us his stepdad also kicked him out of his home and we were staying at cheap hotels and friends houses with the little money we had i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot our honeymoon stage as they call it probably only lasted one month after that it was a downward spiral we were constantly arguing about money food and our families we kept having the famous youre doing it wrongdo it this way argument after six months we moved across the country only to live the same thing and thats when the violence started one afternoon after a serious argument he got into his truck and threatened to leave me i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one he told me to let him leave or he would hit me he had once promised he would never touch me so i challenged him to do it he slapped me and ever since that time when we have serious fights he loses control and hurts me i havent had the courage to leave him and theres really nothing stopping me now i dont live with him i dont depend on him and we dont have children we both havent been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly he always apologizes and at the beginning he was more willing to change now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i dont ever make the effort to try to be okay ive read enough about domestic violence to know that its not my fault that he loses control so thats not even an issue for me i know he has to change that on his own i just want to know if theres people who have gone through this and had the tables turned is there hope for a better future together,domesticviolence,hi winters i learned a long time ago that i cant ever predict who will change and who wont i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change only you can decide how many years to give it i see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though what are you waiting foralthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change it doesnt work that way just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work you can only decide when youve paid too much i bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you hes not your only support

1415,i have a son with my girlfriend but she is emotionally abusive what do i do,i have a child with my baby mother she works i take care of our young son she says she is not cheating i have not found anything but she always putting me down telling me to get out and telling me she doesnt love me but then the next day after our fight she says she does im having a hard time because before our child she said she was raped by a family member but she never went to the hospital or the cops now me and my family dont talk shes always telling me im annoying and just belittles me nothing i do is right she says i work you watch the baby on her days off she never cooks or cleans i have no friends or family and a couple months ago she was confiding to some guy but says hes not any thing to her what do i do i dont want to leave,domesticviolence,it sounds like you are in a tough situation you have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her is it because of the child or is it because you want the relationship to work you must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child so if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move outon the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging it seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship although your question revealed just a short bit of information i didnt read about any positives in the relationship sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you however with time and focus you can do it each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your childhowever if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her you need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you this gives her a chance to render the situation if after this there is no improvement i suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stayi also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy are there any hobbies you enjoy are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefitit is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family you need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment latelythank you for reaching out i wish you the best of luck with your relationship
1416,when should i give up on a relationship,ive known my boyfriend for several years we were friends for a long time in  we started a relationship and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state i planned to move in with him in  after i finished school and he found a job however during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time we decided later to make it work shortly after i found out that i was pregnant i wanted to tell him during his next visit however he never came to see me and instead asked me for money after i gave him money he quit answering my phone calls and texts    soon after i experienced a miscarriage i texted him about what had happened and he didnt seem to care i was extremely hurt by this i still decided to move back as i had originally planned he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him during this time i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know although he says he did i hardly ever see him he never got a job which was in the original plan    after that we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together once we got back together i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in i thought he had too but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman in fact he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her when i confronted him about this he wasnt apologetic he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car i dont know what to do,domesticviolence,there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life i think youll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect
1417,i endured sexual and physical abuse by my brother as child,now i have anger and trust issues how can i treat this and fix myself,domesticviolence,i will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this however i highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas that would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issuethe important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you angry yes at your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you having trouble trusting of course the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries where you end and i begin
1418,why did my boyfriend hit himself in the face during an argument,when i got home my boyfriend and i got into an argument he got upset and he started hitting his face that is the first time he has ever done that but i would be lying if i said that didnt scare me i locked myself in the room,angermanagement,sounds scary to watch  i agree with youmaybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotionsnow that the incident is past bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss itjust the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time may be restorative to himat the very least you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place

1440,how do i deal with my alcoholic boyfriend with a dark past,were in an eight year relationship my boyfriend drinks a lot he experienced childhood trauma i dont know how to deal with violent outbursts,angermanagement,first let me extend my compassion to both of you  it sounds like you have a lot on your plates childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us your question is brief so ill just try to give general answers as best i can from my experiences treating many people with your boyfriends experiences the short healthy answer is that you cant fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help he needs a professional period what you can do is take care of yourself with his background it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way your task needs to prioritize your own safety and wellbeing trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries manage his own emotions and behaviors so your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the nearterm certainly not without professional help you might also benefit from help and support to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life i am not blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriends behavior only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship if you have accepted your boyfriends drinking and violent outbursts in the past by staying in the relationship that is likely to perpetuate his behavior and there isnt any way to handle violent outbursts they shouldnt be handled at all and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe then that may be what you will have to do we can never really change anyone else the only person we can change is ourselves sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another persons behaviors but it doesnt control it i would recommend that you work with a professional to first ensure your own safety above all then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to and which you want to separate from whatever your boyfriend does in his life you will be happier if you manage your own feelings set boundaries etc let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery

the root of it can shed some light on what the problem is and can provide some
relief in itself i would also suggest doing some selfexploration and see a
therapist for individual sessions in order to gain a clearer insight as to what
the cause is there are also several actions you can take on your own to help
control your anger and communicate more effectively here is what i would recommend
you try
take time outs when you feel yourself becoming upset excuse yourself and
take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of
action or redirect your thoughts all together often when we become
angry it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotions get in
the way 
do deep breathing exercises close your eyes breathe in slowly to the
count of  breathe out even slower to the count of  practice this for about
 minutes  times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this
time once it becomes routine for you it will be easier to apply during
situations in which you are angry or upset
change negative thought patterns try and recall or be aware of your
thoughts particularly when you are feeling angry what are these thoughts
telling you are they valid or logical is there factual evidence to support
the negative thoughts often the answer is no learn to stop the
negative thoughts and replace them with logical and more positive
ones 
communicate effectively as a speaker you want to use i
statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming himher
by using you statements for example you might say something such
as i feel sad when you dont come home at a decent hour and i dont get
to spend time with you versus you always stay out late and dont
even care about me the speaker should also avoid using black and white
language such as always never etc as the listener you want to validate what
you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening you will also want
to be responsive and offer fair solutions
i wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes
from"

1453,how can i be less confused about my feelings towards anything,i dont know how to notice or express my feelings besides anger thats really the only one i feel,angermanagement,well then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you havewhat is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings  your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feelsometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they werein some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind  by knowing where your difficulties started you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelingsalso spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are  often people who have difficulty in expressing themselves suffered shame and humiliation as a child  they have a chronic sense of worthlessness and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression  by having a good time being with yourself you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating

1456,how can i control my anger,i have a really bad temper i get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day i dont mean to be that way but i cant help it,angermanagement,a lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves   a surface situation like a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by tuesday and when that particular tuesday comes the store doesnt have what they told you they would and you are furiousthe fury may have more with many times before in your life having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever itif at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life the relationship didnt allow for honest expression of all your emotions youd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearlywithout practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone eventually the person possibly you learned to contain and contain your emotionsit is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately are muting hurt feelings that youve understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history to not talk aboutas a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear  are really the underlying source of your upseti hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions

1461,how can i control my anger,when i see something i dont like i go off like a ticking time bomb i go from  to  really quickly,angermanagement,sometimes we react to situations immediately without thinking of the consequences of our actions typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly one of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing when faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend  minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to  and breathe out even slower counting to  while focusing and thinking only about your breathing after doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate good luck

1463,why do i get random spurts of anger over petty things,im a teenager i get random spurts of anger like complete pure rage i figured it was hormones but others notice it too i get selfdestructive i used to cut but stopped now when i get mad i bite my arms and fingers pull my hair scratch my face or punch my thighs basically i do things i can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom i dont live in a bad household i have a great family a great relationship with my boyfriend and a good job i have no idea what this is and i dont know how to control it its over any little thing tonight it was because i couldnt get my earrings out this happens maybe two to three times on a good week and its always over stupid petty things,angermanagement,hi im glad you wrote in general when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectivelywe just want to avoid it as quickly as possible cognitive behavioural therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively you say that your behaviours are self destructive and i agree it sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem this is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you again a good therapist can help you learn whats behind your shame and selfharm your feelings are normal and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help

1465,i have anger issues i am extremely explosive about the simplest things,i easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger,angermanagement,i suggest that you work on emotional awareness emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and whyemotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you dooften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsbeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodmany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways if a man never learns to say i am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodyou can control yourself and not explode walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you what is the real feeling driving these outbursts maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern it might help to keep an anger journal write down everything that gets you upset that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience
1466,how do i get rid of my nightmares,i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month,sleepimprovement,one of the ways to decrease nightmares is to document your dreams in addition to keeping a dream journal its important to work with the content of the dream and revise the endingits important for you to work with a therapist that is trained in dream work  the researcher  montangero  pointed out that in  using the cognitive approach to dream analysis the therapist follows the basic tenets of cognitive behavioral therapy and that they help the individual to enhance their cognitive skills in order to be able to alleviate their psychological distress for example in the treatment of nightmares one of the methods that is used with the cognitive approach is imagery rehearsal therapy the basic premise of the approach is that those who have recurring nightmares and are experiencing insomnia later come to understand that the insomnia is brought on by anxiety unlike cognitive experiential dream theory the approach does not integrate other theoretical orientations the approach to nightmares and the treatment of them is aligned with cognitive experiential dream approaches as the individual has the opportunity to revise their dream if they have an unpleasant dream although the scary dreams  may not disappear altogether they may lessen in frequency
1467,how do i get rid of my nightmares,i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month,sleepimprovement,theres a narrative approach that we call nightmare rescripting that may be helpfulsince we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening we try to alter them while we are in a waking state  in a nutshell this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have typically there is an element of fear danger or helplessnesssecond we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment control competence andor safety in other words if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted we might change the events of the story so that you call the police get to a place of safety or even fight back and protect yourselfthird you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again so that it becomes a well rehearsed story the effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping this new more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream best of luck
1468,how do i get rid of my nightmares,i have been having horrendous nightmares this whole month,sleepimprovement,are you facing any type of overwhelming situation in your waking lifedreams and nightmares are the nonlogical ways in which we make emotional sense of what goes on in our everyday waking worldbesides having some type of relaxing bedtime routine to set a peaceful mood for your sleep and avoiding viewing violent films and video games as entertainment maybe even avoiding news stories which sometimes have similar themes of violence the content of our dreams and nightmares is out of our direct controlyour nightmares may offer useful clues as to what youre trying to resolve in your life  pay attention to the story of your nightmare because it reflects how you feel in waking lifeif you feel helpless and silenced in your nightmare or taken advantage of or whatever dreadful situation goes on during your nightmare then look for where in waking life you may feel similarin this way youll become clearer about stressors in your life that you may not have realized existed were it not for the stress of nightmares
1469,why do i get a weird feeling every few months or so,i get an uncontrollable swallowing that is repetitive and then somewhat out of body feeling that lasts no more than a minute or two it usually happens in bed at night but i occasionally experience this during the day i have a benign brain tumor but the doctor said it is not associated with this,sleepimprovement,im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening i know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature as far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on these are just some thoughts but i think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start

first good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions  such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated it is really important that you consider your safety above all
else 
to answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other peoples actions there are various
reasons why we do this for one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault and depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it what is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around 
as for the other things you mentioned i am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing it sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school 
you may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on i will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily if you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report 
if you dont know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to they may have some ideas 
sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things you may be able
to find something like that in your state i do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful 
this is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that i encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy try really hard not to let that happen if
you have interests do them if you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well exercise can really help when
we get stressed 
i hope some of this was helpful good luck

1471,ive suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about  years,it takes me a long time to fall asleep id estimate about two hours i often have nightmares starting with being eaten by a monster and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of  years also my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition i was under a lot of stress and life lost meaning after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved however in the past couple months i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning how can i solve this issue,sleepimprovement,"youre noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep there
is quite a bit going on which may be anxiety related it sounds like the
dreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you had
around the time of your break up the difficulty with your fathers business
and your mothers health issues these connections to past events may be
important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about
what your dreams may be trying to tell you there is no exact science to
dreams but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates to
significant themes in their lives i think that exploring these issues further with
a therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress trouble sleeping and frightening dreams"
1472,ive suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about  years,it takes me a long time to fall asleep id estimate about two hours i often have nightmares starting with being eaten by a monster and i often wake up frightened and unable to breathe i believe i started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of  years also my fathers business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition i was under a lot of stress and life lost meaning after improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress my symptoms improved however in the past couple months i started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning how can i solve this issue,sleepimprovement,first of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health thats great that you have added this in your routine have you also considered altering your diet certain foods are linked with poor sleep for example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time  on the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleepadditionally at bed time its important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions ie tv ipad phone stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energyas far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender you may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares finally yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep there are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if youd rather not join a class right away best of luck to you and i sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved zs
1473,why am i dreaming so much,sometimes  times a night,sleepimprovement,perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems  i find that change states while sometimes difficult are very exciting  they give you opportunity to grow more rapidly  so i say congratulations  mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg
1474,why am i dreaming so much,sometimes  times a night,sleepimprovement,dreams are our chance to make sense of our waking livesif youve got a lot going on in your life then your dreams are your assistants in understanding these happenings and dynamics
1475,why am i dreaming so much,sometimes  times a night,sleepimprovement,as a depth therapist aka psychodynamic practitioner i do a lot of dream work with clients and they gain great insights from our explorationswe remember dreams i believe because dreams are messages always in code from the unconscious communicating the crux of unresolved conflict between who we are and who we think we are supposed to be you might be remembering so many dreams because your conscious mind is ready to hear these messagesand make some internal changes in responsewrite them down youll be glad you did a broad crosssection of these these messages will help your therapist help you interpret the meanings of these communications from you to you and possibly chart your best path forward toward to resolve the cause of psychological symptoms you might be experiencing
1476,why am i dreaming so much,sometimes  times a night,sleepimprovement,"thats a difficult question to answer dreaming is a normal and healthy part of the sleep cycle the current thought is that we all generally
experience roughly the same number of dreams  the difference often is just
whether we remember the dreams or notan increase in the number or frequency of distressing dreams
or nightmares can be a symptom of stress anxiety or ptsd  if the dreams are disturbing to you talking to a local
counselor could help if the dreams themselves
are not troubling you may just be remembering them more than most people do"
1477,how can i tell if my spouse had sex with a prostitute,my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex,intimacy,the answer lies in what the outcome will be how will things end if you find out he had sex with a prostitute will you leave will you try to work things out the multiple versions are concerning he seems unable to be truthful and this is damaging your relationship before considering marital therapy please find a counselor for yourself the right therapist can help you uncover what is right for you

1482,how can i tell if my spouse had sex with a prostitute,my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex,intimacy,i am so sorry you are going through this the harsh reality is that you cant possibly know being in a healthy relationship means that you have to trust that what your spouse tells you is true if he tells you he was not with a prostitute and you dont believe him than that means there is lack of trust in your relationship if you are experiencing mistrust in your relationship and are worried about infidelity or stds that is very serious and it sounds like you both could benefit from being in marital counseling together trust is so important in any relationship and if the trust isnt there its important to build that trust so you can have a happy and healthy home together if your spouse is unwilling to go for marital counseling with you then go for individual counseling there have been plenty of success stories when even just one of the spouses goes for therapy

1484,how can i tell if my spouse had sex with a prostitute,my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex,intimacy,

1486,how can i tell if my spouse had sex with a prostitute,my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex,intimacy,that is great that he shared this information with you that you were tested and hopefully everything was okay and that he continues to answer your questions about the event  it sounds like you are still having some trouble with what happened and that is okay and normalnatural  the question i want you to focus on is why you want to know if he had sex with a prostitute  i want you to think about what this information would do for you how you would use it whatif anything would change in your relationship because of this information  i also want to ask yourself if you feel like you trust your husband  has he done anything like this in the past or since he shared this information with you  i dont have an answer for you and you may never know because it sounds like he might not even know  he did share this information with you he did make sure to care for you and make sure you were tested for stds and he does continue to try to answer your questions  im sure he feels a lot of shame and guilt about this experience and understand that you are still feeling hurt and confused by his actions  i think it is important to explore the event how you are both feeling about it and even discuss ways to feel safe when he travels again if that is something that is causing stress and anxiety
1487,how can i tell if my spouse had sex with a prostitute,my spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in amsterdam after he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds in the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute how do i know if he had sex,intimacy,unfortunately you will never know the true answer this is really frustrating to hear but you will never  be able to guarantee that he has given you the truth so if you can work on accepting that breathing through thathe may not fully remember he may have lied to you in the past or he is lying now he may have been honest then or he may be honest not as for options you can talk to him and provide a safe space for him to tell you what happened this could be a private conversation with you or at a counseling session he would need to feel safe to tell you the truth but remember there are no guarantees you would need to make a decision to trust him or not and go from there a couples counselor can help guide that conversation and make sure that he is feeling safe to share more important than if he actually had sex or not i would evaluate your relationship do you trust him now were there trust issues before does he hide things now identifying your current trust levels will be important for having a healthy relationship now hope this helps even if it is frustrating to not have guarantees

1490,i want to have a threesome with my husband and another girl but i feel really nervous,my husband and i had our first threesome recently everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me    he and i talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better and now im craving more of it but before it gets close to happening i get this empty feeling why am i feeling this way,intimacy,because the acrobatics and excitement of sex has nothing to do with the meaning of deeper emotional attachment to another person with whom we are in a relationshiptry to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband

1495,my husband was lying about drinking again,"my husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past hed never admit to this a while back  years ago i asked him to stop drinking so much and he agreed i caught him one night drinking behind my back i confronted him and he lied but i told him i knew he was lying because i counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing he admitted and apologized and promised he wouldnt do it again lately my husband has been drinking on and off but i noticed it was every single night i didnt like this for our new years resolution we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption he was on boardno more drinking every night
 the other night i counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing it took a couple of days but tonight i discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka he was passed out on the couch when i decided to wake him up and confront him poor timing but i couldnt wait i asked him if hed come to bed with me when he drinks he snores and i cannot sleepits a dead giveaway hes been drinking he slurred a bit and said no i asked if he had been drinking but he snapped and said no i went into our room to sleep leaving him on the couch  im not sure if im overreacting or not i just feel like im so honest with him about everything and i expect the same honesty he is a good husband in every other regard",intimacy,hi los angelesso your husband is giving you mixed messages he says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it his behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent it sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partner your husbands lying is sending a message i get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it underneath that maybe its i want to stop but im ashamed that i cant and i dont want you to see my failures ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout pushbackbacklash  how does his drinking affect you thats where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out asking if hes been drinking seems confusing youve mentioned snoring which i guess is a legitimate complaint if hes passing out thats a legitimate complaint when he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you all of these things are legitimate concerns and id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers my guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress so he checks out with alcohol and it also helps him avoid your relationship but the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you then more you chase him with your questionstheres a conversation that would be helpful here  it sounds like ive tried to support you in your drinking less and its not working what are your goals for alcohol and how can i support you in that more effectively id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking but focusing on the things that affect you what concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement can we get the alcohol out of the house is he willing to seek treatment lay your expectations out really clearly i wont count your beers but i cant tolerate lying you have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers or is it something else what do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage what does he need does he let you know what isnt okay with him he might have trouble saying these things the drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage a qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart understanding it and changing the way you relate to each other

1498,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,wait what  normal teenage experiences   a pedophile is someone that is attracted to children meaning under your age category   this is regarding mostly adults that are over age of    you are only one year apart  try and focus on friendship and work on keeping yourself busy in activities so that you are not having these type of thoughts  direct this energy into a more productive activity like sports reading biking exercising or something other than negative thought patterns  dont attract what isnt supposed to be part of your life  good luck
1499,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,you are not a pedophile you are both under  and your age is appropriate for a relationship there would be a possible problem if she was  or younger pedophelia is a whole other problem that you probably should not be worried about i would be happy to talk with you in more detail about this
1500,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,it is very natural for you to be attracted to someone that you find an interest in building a romantic relationship with  these feelings are an emotional response toward adulthood  you are at a healthy age to start the development of attraction and intimate bonds with those around you  pedophilia is a disorder in which adults or older adolescents find themselves continuously sexually attracted to children and minors  at the age of  you are still considered a childminor yourself that is growing into his own adulthood  this is healthy for you to seek the elements of attraction and intimacy  there may be a lot of confusion during this time due to the effects of puberty and all the changes you may be experiencing during your adolescence phase  in this case see if you are able to reach out to your parents caregivers andor trusted adults to seek an understanding of those elements to help with any confusion with age attraction and underage dating
1501,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,a pedophile by definition is anyone who is sexually attracted to children  this is applicable to children to are prepubescent  so im repeating others here but you are not a pedophilethe fact that you worry about this means that you wouldnt be ok with being a pedophile  sounds like you have a healthy reaction to your girlfriend
1502,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,the short answer is no it is not wrong for you to be attracted to your girlfriend you are a perfectly healthy person when puberty hits hormones start changing and it is a natural to be interested and attracted to others it may feel wrong especially if you are a christian and have grown up in that home due to the messages that are sometimes sent your way but as a christian myself and a counselor i remind people that every human is made with a very similar biological makeup if humans did not have an innate attraction to others then the human race would not survive because we would not marry or have children you are not a pedophile
1503,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,nope in fact you are not a pedophile that term is reserved for older adolescents attracted to children or adults who are attracted to children i see an age difference as being one key factor in determining pedophilia if the older person is still in adolescence you being only a year older than your girlfriend doesnt qualify so go right ahead and be attracted to your girlfriend without shame
1504,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,you wrote that each of you is under the age of    a  year old cannot be a pedophile because youre not an adultalso if you mean girlfriend in a romantic way then this makes sense bc romantic relationships include physical attraction to the other person
1505,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,no you are not a pedophile you are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so your both only a year a part so this shouldnt a worry to you like frank said below pedophelia is a problem that wont apply to this situation
1506,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,im  and my girlfriend is  am i a pedophile because im attracted to her and shes under ,intimacy,no thats perfectly normal youre under  too youre only a year older than she is this is absolutely normal what would be wrong is if you did anything to her against her will always remember that no means no respect her respect yourself and be a normal teenager have a healthy relationship holding hands kissing and more should only be done when both are comfortable with it and agree to it although it is frowned upon by a lot of people its no secret that teenagers do have sex even if their parents and perhaps religion would definitely not want them to do it only you can make the choice that is right for you just be responsible in the choices you make some states have laws on what age is old enough for consensual sex youd be surprised how young those ages are a  year old having sex with a  year old would be against the law but someone the same age as her or just one year older is not wrong can be defined in a lot of different ways though is it against the law no is it against your religion i cant answer that for you you can however have a relationship that is not physical in any way its okay to just be with her and enjoy her company you can hang out watch movies together go on dates do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing your relationship can be anything you want it to be
1507,why cant i get an erection with my girlfriend,i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago    why this is happening and what can i do about it,intimacy,i want to be short and brief about this first if you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend your penis is fine however erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis if you are having any sort of mental related concern anxiety depression stress etc it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect after reading your concerns my questions would be what are you thinking about right before and during sex do you feel anxious or nervous during that time have you ever experienced not getting an erection before i am assuming it has do to with what you are thinking and their is a certain amount of anxiety you are having during or right before sex if you want to work this out i would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body meditationrelaxation exercises focus more on enjoying the experience through your  senses what do you smell take it in and enjoy it what do you hear take it in and enjoy it what do you see take it in and enjoy it what do you feel take it in and enjoy it calm yourself not having an erection is not the end of the world and happens all the time to men if you freak out about it it will happen more just relax believe it is normal and try again and enjoy the beauty in front of you
1508,why cant i get an erection with my girlfriend,i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago    why this is happening and what can i do about it,intimacy,sexual desire seems to be straightforward  i like someone and i become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them  but that idea does not always take into account other factors stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs  when we are overstressed for example we often find ourselves ill at the same time  can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress additionally focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection  while this may seem counter intuitive it makes sense in the word of stressfinally its never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor as well you did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body as well
1509,why cant i get an erection with my girlfriend,i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago    why this is happening and what can i do about it,intimacy,first off i want to acknowledge the emotional pain you must be experiencing about not being able to experience an erection  youre not alone and it took a lot of courage for you to post your query here below you will find excellent advice from skilled clinicians regarding your question and concern if you havent done so already id encourage you to checkout the mayo clinics website on this very topic httpwwwmayoclinicorgdiseasesconditionsseasonalaffectivedisorderbasicsdefinitioncononce youve ruled out any medicalorganic issues with either your pcp or urologist i recommend you work with a certified sex addiction therapist csat andor certified sex therapist cst and do some psychotherapy around attachmentfamilyoforigin intimacy selfimage trauma history sex history pornography etc  there is hope
1510,why cant i get an erection with my girlfriend,i love my girlfriend so much i get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her but the two times we tried to have sex i couldnt get an erection weve only had sex once and it was a long time ago    why this is happening and what can i do about it,intimacy,"this is something i have
had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practices focuses  the answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session  if you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives subjective intersubjective objective and
interobjective  also known as the four quadrants in determining where the
challenges are it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situationin this case from the upperright
or behavioral and physical perspective we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked such as blood pressure  we would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornography next we would look at the
upper left quadrant thoughts cognitions identity feelings to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times  if you are worried about your job your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate this can
contribute to your situation  from there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant cultural rules and tools to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift update andor reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges  it would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your familyculture of origin views the profession finally we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant systems laws
rules of society such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available  once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you needto sum your question then
of why you cant keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after look at
your behaviors look at your physical body for issues look at where you picked
up your rules and tools culture and look at your ability to access goods and
services  they all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account  so  as you can see there is no one possible answer to this but several  i hope this helps"

1515,is it possible for a couple to overcome cheating if it only happened once,my fiancé and i have been together for  years and our relationship has always been good the only issue we had was that he felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me    i recently found out he cheated on me with another women he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on,intimacy,infidelity is common in a largest study conducted to date about  of women and  of men admitted to being unfaithful while in a monogamous relationship you are not alone and you can get through this just like countless couples have done before you first of all you need to know that although there may be reasons for his behaviour eg not feeling sexually satisfied those are not excuses he could have chosen to masturbate instead of cheating on you right your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you then there is hope the question is  are you willing to put in all this extra work forgiveness is not easy and it may take a lot of time and effort for you to consciously choose to trust again it wont just happen if you dont work on it and yes its unfair that you are being asked to work on this when he is the one who had been unfaithful even though it is hard you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on you cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the longrun all of this is hard work is he and this relationship worth it are you equally committed to making it work if so dont abandon this relationship just yet work on it together ideally get a few sessions with an experienced couple counsellor and see where that gets you for additional specific ideas check out my tips for how to deal with infidelity in a relationship good luck

felt like he wasnt getting enough sexual attention from me    i recently found out he cheated on me with another women he says he wants his family back but im confused on what to do is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should i just move on,intimacy,i think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question  i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again  once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions  first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work  but theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed  you say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core  would you agree with that or what are your thoughts  were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives  if you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs  for instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested  this is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations  in essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal  until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually  this leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling  you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called the five love languages  its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallythis is a long post im sorry  but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it  so back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this  for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again  of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt  you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back  you cant just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it  but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him  get that bookin conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache  there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place  rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past  i truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there  if you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again

1530,why do i always push my boyfriend away,my boyfriend shows affection but i just push him away every time my boyfriend tries to kiss hug or touch me i almost always push him away im on birth control and it has killed my sex drive     i love him so much why do i do this,intimacy,are you sure it is only the birth control pills which has changed your sex drivemy guess would be that possibly due to the hormonal changes of the pill your own awareness and understanding of yourself in this relationship is what is actually changingbirth control pills control ovulation   they dont directly prevent people from all desire to express affectionallow yourself some time to reflect on how you feel toward your bf   it is possible the birth control pills triggered a change in your attitude toward himand maybe independent of the pill maybe you just are done with the relationship
1531,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,keep doing the crossdressing since you like ityour problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about itnot keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life  usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about usonce you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing  based on their handling of this intimate part of your life you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to themsecrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time   the person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship felt good or at least not worrisome
1532,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,while this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone it is important for you to be yourself  its better to weed out  people who cant accept you to find that one who can
1533,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,thanks for asking this question i think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy for that reason i would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happyas far as telling girls or keeping it a secret i dont really think that its necessarily one or the other at least not the first time that you meet in other words one part of your decisionmaking could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date or perhaps something that you address after youve known each other for a couple of meetings the answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating i would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this it sounds like this is an important part of you so i would think that if you were going to date someone longterm you would want them to know about the most important parts of you including thati also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdressid also ask you to consider this are the people who you say this to expecting it my guess is that the answer is probably not along with that are they going to have questions i would imagine soare you comfortable answering questionsi wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questionswhat exactly is crossdressingdoes that change the gender that youre attracted towhat does it mean to youwhy is it important to youand what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressingthere could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationshipi certainly hope that you find the right person for you i imagine that having this conversation could be stressful especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful
1534,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,normalizing crossdressing and being open about who you are  consider if this could be a dealbreaker  which would encompass considering if you want to be with someone who does not accept you for all you are also explain your personal reasons and the possible reasons many others crossdress how it is not always for sexual stimulation
1535,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,if you enjoy crossdressing and it is an integral part of who you are giving it up for anyone else or to get into a relationship will only lead to resentment and resentment in a relationship usually leads to its demise so i would caution you against giving it up for someone else as you wont be happy and neither will your partner because they will be losing out on getting to know your authentic self stay true to your authentic self and balance that out with dating people who do the same and are open to exploring thoughts and feelings in a relationship you definitely get to choose the right time to share this with a partner and i encourage you if it feels safe to talk about it as soon as you can sometimes just keeping something a secret for a long time in a relationship can also lead to other issues too also if you know the other person doesnt respect this part of you if you find out early you wont waste your time and can move onto a relationship that feels more supportivei hope this makes sense and i wish you the best of luck
1536,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,it would be my professional opinion that the desire for you to keep it a secret at all while yes i could see it as giving you a chance with a girl is something that might be more about a discomfort for you if you are comfortable with your kinks and fetishes if i may call it such not my intention to pathologize in any way though then be as open as you want to be but i also dont know that you need to be announcing it as part of your online dating profile because you do say it bothers girls i ask out which to me implies that that is what youre leading with my hope is that people dont make dating decisions based on your kinky behaviors but more likely that they would make decisions based on your own comfort and security with said kinky behaviors
1537,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,i crossdress and like to be feminine but i am attracted to women but yet that seems to bother girls i date or ask out    how can i approach them about it should i hold back and keep it a secret or should i just be upfront about it i wonder if i should stop or if i should continue to do it since it makes me happy what should i do,intimacy,your happiness and healthiness is key  i would not suggest that you hold back and keep it a secret  you should be upfront about it but perhaps gently bring it up on a date  when thinking about whether or not you should stop think about how it makes you feel  perhaps try to be social at more accepting affirming locations in your area  the people who will accept you for who you are are out there  you may not be looking in all of the places you have available to you
1538,my husband only has sex with me once a month or less,im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this,intimacy,have you said anything to your husband about the way youre feelingstart with thissex is after all a two person enterpriseif he would like to talk about the way youre feeling great and wonderful  the two of you already are continuing to grow trust in your communication and relationshipif he doesnt want to talk about how youre feeling then youre facing a different problemyour feelings are real and need to be handledif you end up facing your feelings of frustration about your husband not wanting to have sex with you on your own then does your husband give you a truthful sounding reason as to why notask what explains his disinterest in having sex with youif he doesnt want to address this question then you are a little further down the rung of trust and care about youdepending on how satisfied you are with his answers will guide you on how much dissatisfaction you can live with and why longterm
1539,my husband only has sex with me once a month or less,im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this,intimacy,feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband i want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you and regardless of outcomes i hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage   if your husband was to work with me id explore with him his understanding of and experience with intimacy in relationship with others furthermore like other male clients of mine id challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his pcp primary care physician andor urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy if there are no physical issues per se i would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin storyline regarding rules roles sex and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories
1540,my husband only has sex with me once a month or less,im feeling rejected and frustrated this is not new the first month we were together sex was about every day then it slowed down to once a month right away i love my husband but i am struggling with this,intimacy,this could have many different origins have you tried asking him about it sometimes starting with asking whether he would be open to having an important discussion can be a good beginning if that starts well perhaps continuing with something like ive noticed that we havent been together intimately or whatever phrasing works for you as much lately can you tell me more about what its like for youwhen asking questions like this it usually helpful to not overuse and perhaps try to avoid using the word why that word tends to trigger really strong emotional reactions in people try starting with what makes instead for example what made you choose not to do that

1542,i feel completely alone in my marriage,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,your question highlights your pain very clearly  what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward my mind immediately goes to a question for you what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for what do you say to yourself about you about your spouse and about your relationship  what do you do in response to these feelings do you ask for what you need  does this lead to arguments  do you stay silent or withdrawvery often couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other and is often seen as critical and nagging  regardless of who started it these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship  if both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together  as the patterns slow down partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities needs and longings and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesnt leave the other partner feeling criticized threatened abandoned or uncared forsome couples can do this without the help of a therapist  the book hold me tight  conversations for a lifetime of love by sue johnson is a selfhelp book based on emotionally focused therapy the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists and has been helpful to many couples that i see  when a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals i recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy such as emotionally focused therapy  you can learn more about eft or find an eft therapist here httpwwwiceeftcomto summarizeyour pain is understandable and valid  its telling you what you are missing and what you wantreconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us express those feelings in a safe way and assert our wantsneeds while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partnerif you can do that on your own and your relationship is responsive thats fantastic  if you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated  pain means this is important  you and your marriage are worth the effort

1545,i feel completely alone in my marriage,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,im sure youve tried to talk to your husband but if not could you have a conversation with him about him and his life his work etc see if he relaxes and opens up to you even a little bit dont try to have a heavy conversation or even unburden yourself to him during this first conversation  just try to be lighthearted and focus on hearing him its the first step towards getting your needs met too and ending any emotional standoff that might have come about between you
1546,i feel completely alone in my marriage,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,what you are describing is something i often refer to as living with your roommate phenomenon this is the idea that you feel like you are living with a roommate and no your partner or spouse  it is not uncommon for members of a couple to report to feel both physical andor emotional distance when we dont feel connected within relationships this can be isolating and lonely the emotional distance often makes us wonder am i important to the other these types of feelings need to be better understood in the context of your own background and upbringing ie who you are and also better understood in the context of your couple feeling reconnected can occur but there is not a one size fits all solutoon as a first step do you or your partner have any ideas of how to feel reconnected have you considering talking to your partner about the emotional void or how about discussing  solutions  together that might help from individual therapy to couple therapy to a weekly date night to inquiring about one anothers personal interest to starting off the conversation of what both of you want and can do to reestablish feelings of connectiveness if this is too frightening ie to address the lack of connection between you and your spouse  a fist meeting with a couple therapist can likely help unpack what the possible solutions for your couple
1547,i feel completely alone in my marriage,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,feeling alone in your marriage is one of the most painful feelings wanting connection with your spouse yet feeling the all too familiar distance thats keeping you apart can be so hurtful but change is possible you might be able to move closer toward each other on your own but since there has been two years of distance i would suggest looking into couples therapy with a trained couples therapist they are trained in helping couples begin to examine whats been happening that has caused a drift in your marriage im also curious if there was a significant event that occurred around the time you started feeling distant if there was something that occurred during this time that is hard for you both to talk about couples therapy can help with this also it can provide a safe and supportive space for you both
1548,i feel completely alone in my marriage,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,communication opens up what is called cognitive space for your partner and allows them to do the same for you the more you know about each other especially your everyday lives creates a bond between the two of you much like the saying goes in the military the same is true for a couple complacency kills it is important for both of you to invest in each other on a regular basis i regularly recommend that both of you take the  love languages assessment and start using each others top love languages to help show each other the positive affection that you feel or at least want to feel for one another start asking about your husbands day trying to learn about all the interactions that he has at work and feel free to ask questions so that he knows you really want to know about him and know him intimately again
1549,i feel completely alone in my marriage,i have been married for  years within the past  years we have drifted far apart we coexist together but there is very little personal interest in each other i often feel that my husband has friends at work that he is more emotional invested in than me i feel very alone and just uncared for is there anything i can do to feel reconnected,intimacy,absolutely your question shows that you are going through a lot of pain and im sorry for that many couples go through this disconnect and hope to come to reconnect before things get to a breaking point what i think can help is the following  understand what his primary concern is understand what your primary concern is what would you like to see different what would he like to see different  be honest about your concern with him having friends be ready for honesty help him understand you feel alone without him feeling guilty let him know how committed you are to making this relationship despite the two of you drifting apart sometimes if you just acknowledge the elephant in the room couplesmarriage therapy

1583,is my boyfriend cheating,he leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me he gets defensive when i ask him stuff we havent had sex in two months he says its because hes not working im pregnant he doesnt like it here and he hasnt been on the mood lately,intimacy,well there certainly is distance he creates between the two of youwhether or not the reason is from his cheating on you is impossible to tell based only on the information here providedyou could open a general discussion about the lack of closeness you feel   maybe hell be more responsive to talk about emotions than about specific actions hes done or not donemostly entitle yourself to the quality relationship youd like to have  your discomfort and distress are valid and theres no good reason to live with conditions which keep these moods in place forevergive yourself time to plan your next move especially since having a baby will add to each of your responsibilitiesyou didnt write how long the problem you describe has continuedone possible outcome if its been a short time is he will resolve whatever currently drives his withdrawn behaviors from youyour life your outcometrust yourself to know when the time is right to stay or to go
1584,what can i do about my husbands black and white personality disorder,after receiving counseling we have been told my husband has a black and white personality disorder when i offer compromises in our disagreements he does not seem to understand we cannot resolve conflict because he only sees things as black or white my husband has asked that we go to counseling this time in the past it has been my suggestion we are thinking of going to a marriage mediator this time because there are financial issues that need to be resolved he cannot see the whole picture when i attempt to explain my side to him,intimacy,i never heard of a marriage mediator beforesince you already went to counseling and the therapist observed your husbands tendency to see black and white in life and because counseling functions on a deeper level than a mediator generally does a marriage mediator sounds like a step backwardswhy not go to a financial mediatorthis would satisfy your husbands black white outlook and may satisfy you too because no emotions are expected in financial discussion and the relationship suffers from an expectations surrounding emotion
1585,can my marriage be saved,i have been married for ten years my husband is  years my senior we have a young daughter ever since she was born my husband has shut down we have no intimacy he doesnt even kiss me ive told him how i feel for years and he swears he loves me and wants to make me happy but i still have to literally beg for sex and affection my selfesteem is gone and i feel so alone he has stranded me he uses his passiveaggressive ways and ignores every comment i make he refuses to talk to me in detail,intimacy,hi smyrnayour husband is avoiding dealing with this problem i understand how lonely you must feel not only sexually but emotionally toofrom what you describe it seems that he wants to be there for you but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue my hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you but i think he does have something to sayyour husband is  years older and youve been together for ten yearsthat puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormonerelated low sex drive as they age its possible that your husband is bewildered angry grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this he may feel like hes letting you down and hes scared it will get worse so hes sticking his head in the sand of course that doesnt help does itthe worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame eventually you stop chasing him and you drift further apart its a bit of a conundrumhow to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities maybe lower your expectations for a bit your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared and that hes not rejecting youjust protecting himselfi would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like sweetheart we both know that somethings not right here i think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better but can we agree that its not i need you to either talk to me about whats happening or please go see a doctor what i need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us either of those things would show me thatin the end you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way if he does neither then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage i wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help just a thought
1586,how can i address my grievances to my boyfriend,with college over my boyfriend and i have such different work schedules since i cant see him often i want to talk more on the phone he plays video games while talking to players so often i feel ignored i find myself always telling him what to do in relation to me things he should know,intimacy,directly tell him what you write hereeither he is losing interest in you or he is simply caught up in short fun w his friends and video gamesa conversation on this subject will give you more clarity on your question

1593,how do i make my relationship with my girlfriend better,shes busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family we dont talk much because of it also we have little fights we want to work it out but we dont know how,intimacy,maybe you can start with having  minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other even if it needs to be on the phone because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time at least you would know there was that time that was set aside that may also help you to rekindle some conversations between youas far as your little fights consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are openended cannot be answered with just yes or no and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing then once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch its also good to restate what you think you are hearing then you know what each other is truly following about this also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming fromalso consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated think of the same for your girlfriend this could be a great discussion to have as well

1595,why is my exboyfriend upset with me,i went to my exboyfriend to reach out to one of his high school friends whos attempted to commit suicide when i went to him to reach out to his high school friend he told me that i put him in a terrible position and put an enormous load on his shoulders he was very angry that i went to him to do that am i in the wrong for going to him to reach out he helped me so much with my depression and bad habits so thats why i thought of him to reach out he made me feel awful for thinking highly of him to help why did he react this way towards me i think hes being selfish,intimacy,im glad you think so highly of your boyfriend and his ability to be there when you would like to talk about things that are important to youi see why you would want them to reach out i also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out it sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friends wellbeing although i cant say that for certainwould you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes five minutes or so you ask him about what made him react that way during this time try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience you can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does this does not mean that you have to agree with what you say but just that you follow i hear you saying that you think hes being selfish im suggesting that just during this conversation you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling in one sentence the goal would be to learn more about his experiencei would not be at all surprised if he is scaredare you aware of what kind of support he wants through this time
1596,my longdistance boyfriend has started to pull away from mewhat can i do,he told me he started to back away because i was asking for too much in the relationship the more i tried to fix things the worse it got i want to make us better again but i dont know how,intimacy,have you asked your boyfriend directly this questionit is a good question and possibly would open a necessary clarifying discussion as to what each of you expects from the other
1597,how do i discuss my fetishes with wife when she is very sexually passive and insecure,,intimacy,do  you know whether the reason your wife is sexually passive and insecure is due to your fetishesmaybe shed be very turned on by your fetishestry to not mix up your hesitancy to speak about your fetishes which she hasnt yet directly heard from you with your assumption that her sexual passivity necessarily means she will reject or withdraw from you when you speak of your fetishes to her
1598,how do i discuss my fetishes with wife when she is very sexually passive and insecure,,intimacy,thank you for asking your question when i read terms like fetishes and that your wife is sexually passive and insecure i cant help but wonder that there may be more going on within the coupleship and with yourself than what has been asked about in your particular question    i invite you to enter into an exploratory journey with an experienced therapist to identify your fetishes and the deeper story behind the who what when where how and why they are important to you additionally consider whether or not you need these fetishes as a requirement or strongly preferred for sexual excitement and in its absence do you find yourself being sexually avoidant with your spouse or suffering from some form of erectile dysfunction    while the fetishes may not be causing you clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning it seems from your question that they might or would cause distress to your wife an experienced clinician could help you and your wife to navigate through this relational terrain ensuring all are heard and that the coupleship is honored best wishes

1602,what can i do when my boyfriend says hes not ready for marriage,,intimacy,i dont know if you have any details regarding what makes him say he is not ready for marriageit may also be helpful to look at what is making marriage so important to you right nowmaybe this is something around which you could have a conversation where you each listen to each other for about five minutes and try to ask questions about what the other person is experiencing to gain more clarity about what is happening this particular type of conversation wouldnt be about reaching a certain solution but just understanding more about yourselves and each other i also recommend prefacing that conversation with asking if the person is open to having a discussion that is important at that timeif this proves to be a difficult discussion consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples even if only one of you goes to see a counselor you may have some clarificationin the meantime try to look at what you have that makes you feel valued special and loved perhaps you can look at the things that make your boyfriend feel that way as well
1603,im soon to be married and ive been messing around with others,im a man and im soon to be married i have been messing around with other men on the side it started as a once in a while thing but its been happening a lot i dont know what to do,intimacy,hello and thank you for your question when faced with these kinds of difficult challenges i usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions what kind of person do i want to be deep in my heart what kind of character do i want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching how would i want others to describe me lets say that you want others to see you as being authentic and you also value authenticity as something you want to live by you may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now that you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart this is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation so please try not to feel alone we all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc and i am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a very hard time accepting themselves thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but i wont lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time for example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove that may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity it may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them i would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are both as an individual and as someones fiancéabove all i wish you well in this journey robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

1612,my boyfriend wants nothing to do with me after his dads suicide,my boyfriend lost his dad to suicide he says that because his dad died so did his heart he says that he cant be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again why is he doing this when we were very happy together he says that i have done nothing wrong but he just cant be with me,intimacy,i am sorry to learn of this  you must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken  to begin he is correct  you have done nothing wrong  this is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive  it is fear  it is anger  it is extreme sadness  it is feelings of abandonment  it is intense emotional pain  it is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional lossi am not familiar with how old this post is but often it will require time and understanding  if he speaks with you encourage him to get grief counseling  do not encourage it for your relationship encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad  start there  good luck
1613,how do i open up to someone,ever since my exboyfriend and i broke up i cant seem to get close to anyone else i know im completely over him but i just cant break down my walls and let someone new into my life,intimacy,hi bend youre scared right that makes sense each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business we are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines  of our happiness in life the good news is that when were just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow i think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here and thats okay we are naturally people of attachment and it wont likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesnt put up walls so part of what i want to say here is dont pressure yourself too much take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow as well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right person first think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship what do you feel proud of what do you need in a partner what mistakes did you make use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partnerlook at your thoughts are you having generalized negative thoughts like no one will ever love me again or im going to get hurt again or i cant trust myself if so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening it sells us a line based on no concrete evidence then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought what is the evidence that i am lovable that there are safe good people out there that i can trust myself eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones its simple but very powerfullastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls what is the evidence of the walls can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls when we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it morei hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time 
1614,how do i handle getting the silent treatment from my boyfriend,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,intimacy,you are in an abusive relationshipnot because of your boyfriends silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful never admits he is wrong and never apologizes it is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship you can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner you can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship i wish you well always
1615,how do i handle getting the silent treatment from my boyfriend,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,intimacy,this has to be very difficult to endureits pretty common for members of a couple to have different ways of resolving conflict very often one person wants to deal with the conflict right away or shortly thereafter and the other person wants to wait one thing that sometimes works is to consider having a conversation when you are not upset with one another about taking some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like i cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hoursmy best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is it could even be that hes learned to handle conflict that waysomething else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an argument and what is not these sorts of discussions can be very difficult and you may benefit from working through them with a mental health professional who has some experience working with couplesas far as what you can do now perhaps you can remind yourself that these things have worked out before that you love him and believe that he loves you or some other statements that are true for you you may also consider finding ways to soothe yourself for example you may find that you like certain outdoor activities or reading a certain type of book or something else that gives you pleasure
1616,how do i handle getting the silent treatment from my boyfriend,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,intimacy,as you say if he does reply it is hurtful but if he doesnt reply it sounds like its just as hurtful though more in my opinion in terms of the longerrange effects on the relationship the behavior he is exhibiting would easily pass for passiveaggression as it is manipulative and controlling through passive withdrawal behaviors and i can assure you that you are not alone in struggling with how to deal with it so many do and thats why it gets done so often because it can for example if you push for connection he stonewalls even more you probably become more distressedfrankly if you and your boyfriend were sitting on my couch in therapy id likely say that the behavior needs to stop in order for the relationship to continue because of how severe it sounds an hour of withdrawal because someone cant deal is reasonable as everyone can shut down from time to time but this feels extreme and is extremely hurtful to you i might even say to him that the behavior needs to stop if he ever wants to be in a healthy loving connected relationship because the amount that you describe him disconnecting severely hurts trust and security one of the first change events in emotionallyfocused couples therapy is for the person doing the withdrawing to be able to use words and communication to help the partner understand what they are experiencing so the burden does fall more on him at the beginning it becomes the partners job to tolerate though whatever his experience isthere is no one tried and true solution to working with passiveaggression but i would most advise limitsetting like i would do in our session in one way shape or form in order for the behavior to stop there has to be consequences to it the more you tolerate it and allow him to come back to you when hes done with his silent tantrum the more you encourage the behavior because he is getting what he wants
1617,how do i handle getting the silent treatment from my boyfriend,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,intimacy,try during a good moment between you to tell him youd like to talk over something about your relationship and that youd like to set a time with him to do sowhen a person shuts down and withdraws the only choice is to withdraw yourself   if this continues on a regular basis after a while the two of you will become increasingly distant and have developed the very unhappy habit of not clearing the air between the two of yougood for you to recognize a problem and be willing to address it
1618,how do i handle getting the silent treatment from my boyfriend,when my boyfriend gets in a snit he gives me the silent treatment for days when i ask what is wrong i get nothing no reply no phone call if he does reply it is something very sarcastic and hurtful he never admits he is wrong and never apologizes,intimacy,this sounds very hurtful for you to be on the receiving end of this you can ask yourself  what am i learning from the way i am being treated   and consider whether or not this is in fact either   a message or value that you agree with and believe will strengthen your relationship and help you to grow as a person or   a message or value that is damaging to the relationship or  to your view of your self and others  once youve considered that and come to your own conclusion you will likely know what you need to do  if youre still stuck you may want to consider seeing an individual therapist for yourself  to process your feelings about the relationship or a couples therapist with your partner to work on improving your communication with each other
1619,my husband cheated before marriagewhat can i do,my husband cheated while i was pregnant with our son with a socalled friend this was before we were married we split and eventually worked things out i thought i trusted him so we got married now he flirts with girls in front of me ive talked to him but nothing helps,intimacy,this sounds very painful for youare you able to tell him how his flirting affects youmaybe he doesnt care enough to change and maybe he doeslong term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices put up with it which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship   or of course you can decide to end the relationship  this choice is quite significant now that you have a child together  give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome
1620,should i let the father of my kids go,the father of my kids and i have been broken up for about three years now we always found our way back to each other he had a baby with someone else hes with but still shows the same love he showed when we was together when hes around he even gets jealous but he ignores my calls,intimacy,your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointmentyou know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship youd likeit is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothingreflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wishdepending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been
1621,should i stay with my manipulative husband,every day for five years my husband mentally abused me and said he will change i have a child with him i try so hard to stay strong for her but at this point i am completely broken i am holding on to nothing but hope and have been for years is there any hope or am i wasting my time,intimacy,i think your own awareness will not allow you to continue in a bad relationshipbe glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband doesfor support and guidance in real time look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationshipsyou are not the first or only one and probably not the last woman who wants to leave an abusive partner  having guidance particular to you and your situation will help you move through what decisions to make as to how to leave this man
1622,my boyfriend doesnt compromise with me,my boyfriend and i have been disagreeing on a lot lately its really coming down to the fact that we want opposite things sometimes i do a lot for him i take care and protect him and in the end he still doesnt trust me weve both come to the conclusion that when i want something and he doesnt want it hes not willing to find a happy medium whatsoever its just nonnegotiable im not sure what to do honestly he doesnt trust me as much as i wish he did honestly sometimes i feel like his enemy and it kills me,intimacy,theres a difference between what you want what you need and what you have being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectivelyyou could use couples mediation to learn assertive communication skills and filter the information needed to resolve or negotiate a solution mi novio no transa conmigoúltimamente mi novio y yo hemos tenido muchos desacuerdos todo se debe al hecho de que queremos cosas diferentes  yo hago mucho por él lo cuido y protejo y al final el no confía en mí  ambos hemos llegado a la conclusión que cuando yo quiero algo que él no quiere él no está dispuesto a encontrar el punto medio  no es negociable  no estoy segura de que hacer el no confía en mi tanto como quisiera que lo hiciera a veces siento su enemiga y eso me mata hay una gran diferencia entre lo que quieres lo que necesitas y lo que tienes  poder identificar y expresar asertivamente lo que quieres y necesitas en tu relación te ayudara en los momentos de negociación   muchas veces las parejas se enfocan en recontar todos los problemas y características negativas a la hora de negociar y eso les impide hablar claramente del problema presente e identificar soluciones específicaspueden usar la mediación de parejas para aprender técnicas de comunicación asertiva y tener asistencia filtrando e identificando la información que les ayudara a resolved o negociar una solución al problema
1623,how can i open up to the ones i love,i have been pushing people away all my life i finally have a great boyfriend who loves me but i keep pushing him away and i dont want to i need to learn to open up,intimacy,figuring out the space we need between ourselves and others is an ongoing and unsolvable task  but it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that  pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life  or it may be serving some other purpose  one helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist  psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the pushing away is serving  it also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction  what were you feeling right before this  did it provide relief  reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the pushing away servesit may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times  this may help him be as sensitive as you need him to be about the pace of the relationship and to understand what may be happening when you push him away
1624,my boyfriends family expects him to take them on dates and he doesnt think anythings wrong,i have been dating my boyfriend for eight years we met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when i met his family who treats him like he is their man they expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around and he thinks its okay,intimacy,well then you learned something new about your boyfriendare you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying togetherthink over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationshipthere are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationshipthe key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to livealso an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion   he may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you
1625,i started dating someone and found out they lied about some thingswhat should i do,hes lied about his pastpresent situations since time has passed he has changed but i still have my doubts i have no idea if i should stay or go but i hate this feeling i dont trust him all too much but yet he hasnt done anything for me not to trust him recently,intimacy,your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him againotherwise how would you actually know whether hes lying to you now or notstart the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truthif he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past
1626,how can i be able to trust the person im dating again after ive been lied to multiple times already by them in the past,,intimacy,good questionthe starting point is to directly tell the person you dont trust them your reason for this and what you feel is necessary in order for the person to regain your trustsince the person broke your trust then this person is the one who must earn it backoften the one who was lied to will like to ask many questions about matters which usually wouldnt even come upas long as your dating person is willing to accept their responsibility to earn back your trust then the person would naturally understand and be willing to answer your questionsit is not too hard to see that if someone lies then they are the one who must show themselves to be worthy of being believed again
1627,what can i do about my fiancé putting his family first before our family,my fiancé of  years is always helping out his family and i feel like his family takes advantage of his kindness were about to get married this saturday but i feel like he is always gonna put them first instead of myself and our three kids i am not enjoying our engagement at all,intimacy,congrats on your upcoming weddinghave you told the thoughts you write here to your fiancé this is the place to start since you clearly are unhappy with a part of his and now your life which will be with you for quite some time
1628,how can i regain my boyfriends trust back after being completely dishonest with him about a lot of things,the eight months ive been dating my boyfriend i have lied about a lot of things i slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me now anything i say to him he wont believe even if im being honest i dont know what else to do at this point he constantly criticizes me,intimacy,start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trustask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you againif you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you then after a few months of this both of you should feel more secure in the relationship
1629,can someone love you and say hurtful things,someone i care about told me im not teachable and im irritating i just want to be happy and wanted to please the person but i always fall short it seems,intimacy,pleasing someone certainly does feel satisfying  if the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfyingoffering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe heretell the person that you are trying to please them and also tell the person that their comments are hurtfulif the person said their words with no bad intentions then next time they comment its reasonable to expect these comments to not hurt your feelingskeep in mind that your good intentions may not be received in the way you intend them  some people sometimes are insensitive or just plain not interested in being pleased by another person
1630,am i being picky when it comes to my boyfriend,ive been in a relationship for almost a year and i absolutely trust my boyfriend he treats me nice checks on me and tells me sweet things however when it comes to making life decisions i feel he is very immature i try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting as far as dates if i dont say anything plan it or have money to chip in we will not go i feel like i put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling and all i get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion,intimacy,well then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or notone point to keep in mind is thisjust because hes not telling you his opinions doesnt mean he doesnt have any opinionsin the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesnt tell you what is in their mindshort term it seems easy to have someone agreeablelong term someone who doesnt tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways
1631,how can i stop being jealous of my best friends boyfriend,my best friend and ive been really close for almost three years she lives in the uk and i live in the us ever since her boyfriend flew from oregon to scotland ive been angry at him ever since he came into her life he took her away from me my best friend would always say sorry and im sick of it,intimacy,you are definitely in a frustrating situationyour friend and the boyfriend are doing what is natural for couples who are in the early stage of their relationship  being almost inseparable to the point of overlooking friends is understandable as long as it doesnt continue for long enough that friends feel hurtif you feel you would like to one more time tell your friend that you miss your friendship with her and would like her attention then do soafter expressing your needs as much as possible and if the result doesnt change then the sad conclusion is that your friend is willing to give you less time and energy than you require from her
1632,what should i do after finding my boyfriend flirting on dating websites,i found the guy im dating on dating websites he was telling women that they were beautiful he said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked it has since happened two other times he says he loves me and im the only girl he wants to be with but i feel he is not telling me the truth,intimacy,tell him what you know and ask why he is lying to you   if he tells you he isnt lying and you have proof that he is then you can either accept that he denies the truth or not
1633,what should i do after finding my boyfriend flirting on dating websites,i found the guy im dating on dating websites he was telling women that they were beautiful he said it wasnt him and that the phone was hacked it has since happened two other times he says he loves me and im the only girl he wants to be with but i feel he is not telling me the truth,intimacy,i would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create for example you may want a relationship where honesty listening compassion and romanticism are major parts you could also see what your boyfriend wantsyou may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking openended questions not being answered with yes or no and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right after that perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking openended questionsremember that it takes two people to have  a relationship so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have
1634,my wife wants to spend time with her family instead of celebrating our anniversary,,intimacy,did she tell you her reason for thisif not then ask her for her reasoningalso please tell your wife that you would like to celebrate your anniversary tighter with her   maybe she doesnt know this
1635,my boyfriend does not do some sexual things with me that he has done with other people,my boyfriend wont touch me intimately he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me i know he has done this things with other women in the past i dont know why he wont do them with me what should i do,intimacy,first off dont blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions  human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times eg what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time there could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxietymaybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner thats left him scared to try again we call this operant conditioning  it could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers  sometimes i refer to this as the hookerhousewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal  drives many partners crazy until theyre aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them it could also be that hes not even aware that hes not doing these things if you havent asked him yet you might try gently approaching the subject when youre not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you or has enjoyed in the past or thinks he might enjoy  you can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him  give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if hed be down to go downtown  baby it really turns me on when you kiss me during sexif you continue to get the impression that its somehow only about you or that hes just really hesitant to talk about sex in general you might see if hed be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy
1636,my boyfriend does not do some sexual things with me that he has done with other people,my boyfriend wont touch me intimately he wont kiss me while we are having sex and he wont have oral sex with me i know he has done this things with other women in the past i dont know why he wont do them with me what should i do,intimacy,ask himhaving a conversation about sexual satisfaction increases emotional intimacynot only will you potentially feel more deeply connected from a sincere conversation about your sexual questions maybe this increased emotional closeness will inspire the sexual closeness you wish to receive
1637,my boyfriend of a little over a year has a problem with me going to visit my mother,he said that if i were to visit my mother he will be gone when i get back my boyfriend and i hit a rough patch in our relationship a few months back and my mom had a few choice words with him,intimacy,your boyfriend and you have a separate relationship than your relationship with your mother   by trying to control whether or not you visit your mom unless you are in agreement with this is building tension between you and himask why he resents your interest to see your motherif he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward himif something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother
1638,what should i do about my marriage and my wifes behavior,my wife and i got separated because i asked about her contact with a male friend of hers the next day she kicked me out she let me move back two days later yesterday she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind i asked if the other guy was a factor but she says its not my business,intimacy,when threats of leaving such as what you described in your question kicking you out wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship impacting both partners and if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship from the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship if your wife is willing i would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time or for you to talk with an individual therapist if marriage counseling isnt an option

1646,should i be upset that my husband may have lied to me again,im trying to make marriage work after a split before our split he lied a lot and broke every promise to me i dont think he cheated last month i asked what women work with him so he told me yesterday i found out about a girl that he said he forgot about should i be upset,intimacy,is really difficult to tell whether he honestly forgot about someone or whether he was really lying againi dont know whether he would be open to having a discussion with you about your concerns about this and whether you would be actually willing to listen to your thoughts about itthis might be something to discuss with a local therapist so that you can look at the patterns of lying in the past as well as whether you have a way to discuss this with your husband in the way that you would feel comfortable feeling vulnerable with your own feelings and also listening to what his responses arethis is difficult because i imagine you have a react very quickly and strongly to things like this because of what has happened in the past between you all of this make sense having said that there is also a question of whether he is telling the truth in this particular case and your reaction is based on past eventstheres no easy way to knowif you do decide to have a discussion with your husband about it  consider these thingsask if this is a good time to have a conversation about something that is important to youmaybe you will be able to listen and ask questions about what came up for him emotionally when he realized that he didnt tell you about this other personmaybe he would be willing to listen to what you are thinking about if you are both able to do so without blaming pointing fingers or asking the other person to change this would just be an exchange of information ideally this part of the competition would not be about you saying he did something wrong but just expressing how you felt when you heard about itit may be helpful to discuss these things with a therapist first so you have some coping skills for being able to listen to him without being overly defensive and also expressing your feelings without blaming both of which would be very natural in this situation

1651,why is my fiancé angry at me about his automobile insurance,my fiancé and i recently had an argument over finances he gives me the money each month to pay his automobile insurance he no longer has one of the vehicles on the policy he realized he was still paying for the coverage and asked why i was allowing him to continue to do that since i was physically paying it for him my response was that he was giving me the money and i just made the payment i didnt think of the coverages he was angry about it i still cant figure out that anger,intimacy,id be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per sewhat you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilitiesstart by withdrawing yourself from paying his billsif he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy then surely the only one for him to blame will be himselfstay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountabletell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you

1671,is it wrong to cheat on my husband,we dont have sex a lot i cheat when we argue i dont kiss or have unprotected sex with them its a one time thing and i never see them twice,intimacy,"hello and thank you for your question the question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you however here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
    
do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals this is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy if you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that however if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright finally if you value your husbands feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values that can only be determined by you 
      based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is  from the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument this
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt we can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep the pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs 
       what are your goals for this relationship if we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed none
of which requires any intimacy at all are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
      
have you considered seeking marital counseling not
having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them if there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed 
 hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship i certainly
wish you well

1672,i am afraid of sex,i am a female and i am afraid of having sex i am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced i think he thinks im not a virgin i am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body i dont want my partner to think differently of me because i am afraid of having sex,intimacy,these fears are completely normal almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience men also feel far more of these fears than you realize that can helpto remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approvalyou mention a partner but im not sure if you currently have one having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important when youre really confident someone cares deeply for you this can help the fears to go away or diminish how well do you know your own body getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feelgetting acquainted with your body yourself firstthis can help build sexual confidence in general our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear asideironically this is what makes you good in bed but be patient with yourself your confidence will grow with experience and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready theres not rush

1675,i cheated on my partner and i dont know how to feel,i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like,intimacy,i dont think theres anything that youre supposed to feel some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all it could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions when something we do is hiddena secretits easier to avoid feeling guilty i wonder if youre avoiding your own emotions but lets put that question aside for now there are better questionswhat do you want do you want your marriage if not this may be why you dont feel guilty do you want to be able to sleep with your friend its unlikely that both are possible keeping the marriage and the affair yes you get to do whatever you want with your bodyandthere may be consequences affairs almost always get discovered who do you want to be what kind of partner do you want to be what might your partner feel if they knew how might you feel then would you care has something happened thats affected how much you care about your partneri suggest that these other questions might be a place to start exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe i wish you the best as you sort it out 
1676,i cheated on my partner and i dont know how to feel,i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like,intimacy,my questions to you would be  why did you get married  would it bother you if your spouse did the same to you
1677,i cheated on my partner and i dont know how to feel,i am married but i had sex with my friend i feel guilty but i feel not guilty too do i need to feel guilty its my body and i have full rights to do what i like,intimacy,yes of course its your body and you can do what you feel like doingdo you feel a commitment to your partneryour guilt probably is pointing out the feeling of having done with your body what your spirit tells you is a violation of the commitment you feel toward your partnerthe good news is that this is a moment for you to examine how strong your commitment is to your partnerfind balance between satisfying your freedom to do as you please with your sense of being a partner which means prioritizing the partner once in a while
1678,i think my trust issues are going to end my relationship early,as i was growing up my mother and father always fought with that i grew trust issues i think its going to affect my relationship now and end it sooner then i want to i try not to let it affect me but i cant,intimacy,if you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship  dont allow their problems to become your problem  you didnt mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them  like in the court of law if no evidencefind not guilty  dont make them pay the consequences as if guilty of your parents unhealthy behavior
1679,how do i stay when the spark is gone,we had our first kid  years ago and sex has been nonexistent ever since it only happens every three or four months we have been to counseling and i have been told over and over again she will come around she hasnt and im intimately lonely i think its time to move on but how do i do that without hurting my kids,intimacy,hi pocahontas this is a painful situation when youre in a relationship you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection when it dries up its a very lonely place its possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship its also possible that your partner has hormonal issues pain issues  sexual dysfunction or is asexual there is no one answer here only you can decide what is right for you but let me ask some questions to help you explore next stepsaside from the sex is your wife loving and supportive what are the other ways in which you feel loved does your wife talk to you does she communicate her needs and desires does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex if your wife is generally a loving open partner you use this to see that her behaviours arent personal whether she resolves this or not it can help you to cope with the rejection this is your wifes issue and the ball is in her courtin my opinion if couples therapy hasnt helped its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship if you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out it can help you manage your own emotions pressure to have sex might push her further away did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship one good way to make sure you get is to give and i mean give what she wants not sex its appropriate to say to her now i cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy i need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually if this is all you want im not sure i can do it if you want us to be more sexual i need you to address what gets in the way for you  give her some time help her in any way you can and then see where you are see if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers thenyou have a decision to make i encourage you to make it looking at the big picture not just the sex
1680,i dont know if i should end my relationship or try and stick through it,i have been dating a guy for two years i think i love him but i dont know any more i am in my late teens and i have been living with him for most of our relationship i have been talking to a guy friend and i feel more loved by him than my boyfriend,intimacy,hi michigan relationships are so sparkly for a few years and then things start to feel different most of the time this is simply because weve pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning we stop talking a lot because we have less to discoverwe do less for each other and buy fewer giftsspend less time togetherall because we have already formed the love and attachment and we dont need to fill the gas tank as much so just because it feels different doesnt mean its gone badhaving said that it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need you dont feel loved enough right now can you tell him have you told him the strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are let him know what you need and see if he gets it you have choices to make and there is no wrong choice you certainly have the right to say this isnt feeling great anymore or i want to explore other relationships and walk away but often its worth it to see how good something can be before you bail youre drawn to someone else and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new your boyfriend cant compete with that if he doesnt know youre unhappy for some people being drawn to someone else is a sign theyre not into their partner for others its a danger alert and it makes them want to improve their current relationship which one are you
1681,my boyfriend says he doesnt like to do things with me because we fight too much,he owns his own business sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me we have a son together and i get to stay home with him he says i complain too much about what hes doing weve been together a year and a half i got pregnant after being together for a month we moved in together when i had my son in july everything was great and then he started the staying out he then started not spending time with either of us i just dont know if im doing something wrong weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before,intimacy,congrats on the birth of your sonyour situation sounds painful lonely and isolatingand these features are eating away at your selfconfidencestart by believing in yourself  the feelings and ideas you describe here would only be arising from within you because they are at the very least partly trueask your boyfriend if he is willing to listen and understand your point of view  if he does then hopefully the two of you will more easily talk with one another about the truth of feeling overwhelmed by the quick pace of your courtship and becoming a familyif these discussions continuously include him blaming you for having your own feelings and expecting him to more actively be a part of your and your sons life then youll need to start valuing your feelings and what is best for you and your son by yourselfi send you lots of good luck
1682,my boyfriend says he doesnt like to do things with me because we fight too much,he owns his own business sometimes he stays out all night but doesnt tell me we have a son together and i get to stay home with him he says i complain too much about what hes doing weve been together a year and a half i got pregnant after being together for a month we moved in together when i had my son in july everything was great and then he started the staying out he then started not spending time with either of us i just dont know if im doing something wrong weve talked and he says this is just how he is but he wasnt like this before,intimacy,hi oklahoma listen to him when he says this is how he is your boyfriends behaviours are about him not you at the start of a relationship its easy to be loving and attentive but it takes years to really get to know someone deeply with time people reveal who they arefor some reason he is giving himself permission to detach from you and your son this could be for several reasons he may be avoiding intimacy and connection he may be avoiding commitment he may fear he isnt enough or and there is evidence of this one he may have misogynist attitudes about male privilege that interfere with his ability to be the kind of supportive and respectful partner that you need it seems that youve addressed this problem with him and told him what you need good for you his response seems dismissive though and this isnt a good sign any problem can be worked through if you have two people who care about respect and listen to each other it seems this basic foundation is missing herei suggest a therapist might be able to help you sort out where to go from here i wish you the best 
1683,my boyfriend is always accusing me of not loving him,i love him so much and i dont know what to do,intimacy,does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you dont love himask him this so you will clearly know his definition of love
1684,my boyfriend is always accusing me of not loving him,i love him so much and i dont know what to do,intimacy,hi savannah this is a pretty common issue one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving yet their partner doesnt feel loved theres a great book the five love languages by gary chapman he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we dont necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner you might feel that by going out to work and earn money youre being loving but if your partners main love language is quality time youre not hitting that bulls eye because youre not home the five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch i recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partners language a bit better you may never be fluent but you can get better the most important part is to understand each other better and to know that theres nothing wrong with either of you youre just speaking different languages you can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved i bet he just needs you to speak his language  
1685,how can i get my fiancé to notice me again,my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore,intimacy,hello it doesnt feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you especially if your feelings have not changed it can be scary frustrating and lonely have you tried talking to him about your concerns i would suggest to start there there may be several reasons for his actions some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and depending on his response may cause some relief when initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive there are a few things that you want to remember tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong avoid using extreme black and white language ie always and never for example you may say something such as i feel confused that we are rarely intimate and im wondering if youve also noticed this change versus you are never intimate with me anymore dont be afraid to ask him questions you deserve to know what is going on as his behavior is effecting your well being i like to ask openended questions instead of yes and no questions it allows for more clarity and deeper explanation lastly ask yourself and possibly him what part you play in the recent changes does he feel that youve been distant does he need something from you let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team if communication attempts fail seeing a couples therapist can be a great benefit having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationshipbest of luck to you
1686,how can i get my fiancé to notice me again,my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore,intimacy,your situation sounds a little painfulhave you brought up any of these topics for discussion with your fiancénow is a good time for finding out if and how your future husband is interested and addresses the way you are feelinguntil the two of you open up what bothers you all you or anyone who talks to you about the situation can do is take guesses as to what is driving your finances behaviorsalso in the moment of when your fiancé texts you words you find surprising or startling you can tell him this   maybe by being clear and truthful about how what he writes affects you then next time he will change what he tells youand if he doesnt then you know that you explained yourself he had this information about you and that  he isnt that willing to consider what you told him really the best first step is to open up all the topics you wrote about here with him  this way youll give each of you to discuss how to care about one another in a meaningful way
1687,how can i get my fiancé to notice me again,my fiancé and i have almost the best relationship every girl wants but lately its changed i get less attention and little to no intercourse he works a lot and goes to the gym a lot hes a football player for an indoor league but he has no time for me we live two hours from family and when i leave home to see family hell text me saying whatever and leave me alone but when were together everything is okay no fighting or anything i love this man but i just dont know what to do anymore,intimacy,hi rockford while no relationship is perfect and its natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we dont have to smother each other with attention anymore your situation sounds like something different he has no time for me yet you dont fight hmmmis it that you dont fight because you dont bring up whats bothering you are you avoiding conflict many people do what do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away as an engaged couple now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real or maybe you have spoken to him about it if so what happens does he listen and help you understand him better or does he avoid and reassure youor maybe dismiss you this is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together he says leave me alone thats a pretty bold statement about what he wants he doesnt seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is and how close you want to be plus i have to say those words sound more like what a closedoff fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be giving him the benefit of the doubt it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change but if this is true he needs to tell you that so you can understand so i suggest that the fact that when youre together youre okay is perhaps not the best barometer for how youre doing as a couple listen to your gut i encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are this may get rockier before it gets better but until you face whats not working you wont know who you truly are as a couple  when youre engaged its a really cool time to see a therapist tooto get some conflict resolution skills down before youre a married couple
1688,how do you get over someone cheating on you when you are trying to make it work,my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up weve since gotten back together and are trying to make it work i dont know how to trust him now but i really want to make it work and it seems like he does too but my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems,intimacy,hi michiganthis is a common issue how do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you i totally get that its hard and i believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone you can be stronger in the scarred places i would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust it is definitely possible to rebuild it because anything is possible if both people want it enoughyour boyfriend came clean to youthis is pretty crucial he chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret you can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file work on that filethicken it up having a thick he does care about me and wouldnt hurt me again file will help you other things that he can do to help you thicken that file because after all his behaviours caused this problem answer all your questions dont brush you off if youre feeling insecure treat you as though youre a priority avoid questionable contact with other women have open communication give you passwords to devices so there is transparency he can help you to understand where those behaviours came fromwhy he cheated in the first places although people arent always good with those why questionsyou can focus on telling yourself that people change that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal or at least youve decided to give him that chance and that you want to be a trusting person if you act like a trusting person you will likely feel more like one dont go snooping dont interrogate him its normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scaredthis is a start for you a good therapist can be helpful too
1689,is it wrong that im married and i have a best friend thats like a sister to me,,intimacy,although we all want or wish that our partner is also our best friend in reality this doesnt always happen there may be issues of course and there are many things to consider there such as why do we need another person to confide in or are we actually attracted to this best friend but because we know we cant have them we put this thought behind etc etc is this friend and old friend an old flame or a new acquired friend the latter is complicated and probably the most questionable in my view so many things to think about and there is no one answer fits all
1690,am i a lesbian because i love a girl,im in love with my friend who is also a girl i fell in love with her in a few months that was my first love we used to talk for the whole day and night over the phone and on facebook i thought she had the same feelings for me but i was wrong i always wanted to touch her warmly and stay with her all my life but all my dreams get broken apart after she got into a relationship with a guy ive tried to be in relationship with guys but i cant be in love with them,intimacy,it all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is  you may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real this is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person time will tell but if you need to discuss this you could see your school councelor if you are at schooluniversity or find a lgbt group with meetings and discuss this with them i hope this is helpful
1691,is it wrong to be antisocial around people,ive been getting told lately by my partner that its embarrassing that im so antisocial around his family and friends i believe its because im not as social as him,intimacy,hi buffalo i think youre right your partners reactions are about him i have to say its a cruel thing to say to someone you lovethat youre embarrassed by them the subtext says youre not good enough and i love that you can reject that false messageyou dont have to be different for anyone if he cant accept you for who you are what is he doing with you your social habits unless they are extremelike you refuse to go anywhere arent a reflection on him its just you being you also and im sure youve found thisthe more he judges you the more difficult it is for you to be the confident outgoing person he wants you to beso his method of trying to change you doesnt even worki think thats the cruxhes trying to change you what does that make you want to do
1692,what should i do if i think my partner is cheating,how can i know if im just being paranoid,intimacy,hi texasoh thats a powerful idea isnt it it burrows into your head lets figure this out first has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them have they cheated before if not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence if its a yes then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that youre hiding something i need openness if they havent cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on what is the specific thing thats triggering your fears when you have your data recorded read onthe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fearpeople cheat for their own reasons not because were not interesting this may be true if what you wrote down is they didnt really do anything wrongthere is no evidence im just scared and suspicious thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened i can trustif what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or youre having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions trust your gut but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheatingits evidence of something ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptionsthe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you i hope that helps
1693,my partner is bored of being intimate with me,my partner and i have had an amazing relationship and connection for over two years were very committed to each other and are planning a very long life together however he recently was very open and honest that he isnt interested in having sex with me anymore he says this has happened in every past relationships and has ended it as a result he knows its because its the same person feeling but how can he get over this,intimacy,i wonder how long anymore will be for your boyfriendsince you both are planning a long life together instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committedwhat are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationshipknowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like
1694,how do i get over the man i had an affair with,we got into arguments and we would break if off but start it back up again we clicked or so i thought we are both married with problems in our marriage we never have sex we just send a lot of pictures back and forth and talk about doing things together his wife found out and he lied to her and didnt even refer to it as an affair i cant stop thinking about him we just click ive been married for  years and ive never liked anyone other than my husband now i like him and well never be together,intimacy,if you will never be together and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved there is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible then maybe you want something else for your life  if you and your husband are willing i would encourage you to do some therapy or counselling together  you may enjoy this article to learn a little more about some factors that lead to connection or disconnection and that predict separation and divorce
1695,how can i get over the past in my relationship,my boyfriend of five months expresses how much he cares for me and loves me and i believe it it has been one of the best relationships i have been in for a short period of time but he has lied to me so much hell tell me that hell stop lying and while hes saying that hes hiding something or lying about something first it was about a girl he hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in next was his exgirlfriend he put a fake contact name and it was just friendly but he lied to my face all the time he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better,intimacy,new york new yorkits not your boyfriends lying that concerns me the most its the lies you tell yourself verbal expressions are easy but its walking the walk thats more important in the end when someone shows you what theyre capable of you can believe them hes capable of being manipulative and deceitful and he even lies as hes telling you hell stop lying what youre doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence he might love you with his heart but love in the end is a verb and is based on respectful loving behaviours my wish is that you start by believing in what you deserve
1696,my boyfriend wants me to sign a contract of things not to do,i was texting a guy who wasnt my boyfriend and my boyfriend found out we work together so he went to work and told everyone i was cheating on him i moved out of the house there have been previous problems and i feel like im usually the issue here in order for us to move on he wants me to sign this contract that he wrote out listing things he doesnt want me to do anymore im wondering if this a healthy relationship to save or if i should walk away,intimacy,hi dallas while i think its healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds onesided and rigid will you have a list too there are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forwarddoes he decide when you move in and out your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you dont have a voice in this relationship do you have a voice if you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice if you cant hear your own voice maybe its time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and wantno relationship is all good or all bad wouldnt that make it easy relationships dont come with billboards that tell us what to do they dont come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor you have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you youre too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly a therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is
1697,i found my boyfriend talking to his exgirlfriend,about a month ago i went through my boyfriends phone and found him messaging his exgirlfriend that he was dating before me he gave her a promise ring when they were together and he still had it hiding in his memory box in our sons room i found many things on his phone but that broke my heart the most he deleted all the messages but two i cant help thinking they were talking about the old times together or something like that it really kills me and i cant stop thinking about it,intimacy,your sense of hurt is very understandabledo you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phonesi ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationshipprobably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the otherwith this new level of clarity his  past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little

1700,should my wife and i seek any kind of counseling if she is convinced our marriage is over and has turned romantic love into platonic love,over the course of a few days my wife was unsure about her feelings for me due to constant intimacy issues after she thought things through she came to the realization that she is no longer in love or attracted romantically to me she instead has more of a platonic love and just cares for me as just family at that point she said our marriage was over now over the course of the last few days she has taken a friendship from a coworker she insists there is nothing more than friends but she has spent all her free time with him,intimacy,hi portlandthis must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend i get how upsetting this isif i was your therapist id want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening be careful not to jump to conclusions sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage she may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said so its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisisshes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist but its not your place to tell her to do this or its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her  right now its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate if shes asking for that we cant trap people in a marriage if she needs separation or distance then its respectful to give her thatthat doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now i would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what you want whether its to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of time i cant predict what will happen here but you can find out what the best path for you is i wish you the best
1701,what does it mean when my wife says she loves me but isnt in love with me,,intimacy,usually someone means by this that the person cares about you feels warm and friendly has an interest in helping you believes you have positive qualities such as kindness and are generally a likable person toward whom the person feels affectionromantic love and intimate involve a deeply felt dynamic that is unique to the particular couple  the dynamic results from the shared identity of being part of that particular couple  loving another person is a one way dynamic of one person toward another personin love is appreciating and freely wanting to continue contributing to the couples shared dynamicgood luck in understanding more about your happiness and satisfaction in the current relationship
1702,why do i feel so lonely these days,i have no idea what happened i go places and do things but still feel lonely i honestly have no friends and i am always the one texting people and bothering people i feel invisible like someone that no one wants to be around,intimacy,a lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situationsis it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your lifeif yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choiceat the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you firstalso most relationships are not forever  is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity
1703,why do i hate sex,i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration i hate it i dont know why but i just want it to be over i feel like crying i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it,intimacy,although i am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area an initial question i have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing  if you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over  i would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time  until you figure out what is going on  i encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations if any  about being sexually active  do you fear pregnancy  are there problems in the relationship  are you afraid of the emotional intimacy another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way   when these types of traumatic events occur  people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma  such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with  if this is the case i strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues a final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration  if so i would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems  although pain can also be associated with emotional issues it is always good to rule out possible physical causes  i hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction  take care
1704,why do i hate sex,i love my boyfriend and everything that leads to sex but when it comes to the actual penetration i hate it i dont know why but i just want it to be over i feel like crying i dont know why i dont like it because all of my friends enjoy it,intimacy,does your boyfriend notice that you hate sexif yes then it is a topic which the two of you would gain deeper understanding of each other by discussingif no then possibly one reason for hating sex is that your boyfriend doesnt notice who you are as a person not simply a physical body engaged in sex
1705,how do i get my wife to forgive me,i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust,intimacy,hello being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her if so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back couples counseling would be of benefit if not then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from there are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them the issue is not likely to get resolved in the meantime i suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship hope it all works out for you both
1706,how do i get my wife to forgive me,i didnt trust my wife when i found out that she had a new guy friend that she was texting and calling i investigated him before i found out that he was gay and that there was nothing going on now all my wife and i do is fight about trust,intimacy,instead of fighting about trust is it possible for you and your wife to talk with other about areas which upset each of youwhenever feelings are hurt knowing what exactly is problematic and being heard and understood by the partner goes a long way to building trustthese type of discussions are hard to have and especially for the first time  a lot of emotions arise and often people lose their conversation focus from thisif you and your wife have a tough time opening up to each other consider scheduling time with a couples therapistjust by each of you committing time to invest in the relationship will show faith in the relationship and this may contribute to restoring trust
1707,how can i stop myself from making poor choices and hurting the one i love,ive been in a relationship for over a year hes cheated and lied i heard hes married but he says hes not everything is very up and down theres no trust recently he went on a trip and i promised him id behave and not drink because when i drink i drink too much and i tend to make poor choices this time i made a huge mistake i drank too much and i cheated on him i slept with another man for about five minutes before realizing what i was doing is wrong i told him and he just got really rude he called me names and threatened me i feel bad as i do love him we just have so many issues im not a bad person ive just made a lot of bad mistakes its unintentional and i know right from wrong but why do i still make the wrong choice,intimacy,hi calgary canada  let me get this straightyoure in a relationship but he might be married you both cheat and lie and hes abusive the short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it relationships dont heal us and they dont help us grow up we have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before its going to work id recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while you have a lot to sort out i wish you the best
1708,my wife no longer wants sex,i crave attention companionship and sex she has had a hysterectomy and she has a bad knee,intimacy,hi hamptonalthough id bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now i also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you this is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs if you both want the relationship to improve a couples therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea its a complex picture that youve only given us a glimpse ofin the meantime you can try a few things have compassion for your wife shes in pain and this may preoccupy her sex may be uncomfortable for her she needs understanding you need understanding too right  help her to see that youre not just angry but lonely and hurt it might affect how you see yourself as a man showing her irritability or anger might push her farther awaythere are many ways to be close intimate and sexual that dont involve intercourse you might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you wont pressure her to have intercourse find out what your wifes wishes and ideas are you might be surprisedthese things take time to address especially if theyve been years in the making i do recommend seeing that therapist relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change best of luck
1709,do i leave my cheating husband or share him with someone,"ive been with my husband for eight years now we have split twice before and the first time was because he cheated i took him back months later and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes however we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust my insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse which lead to us separating again during that separation he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child
   the baby was a few months old and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her he told me how he could never stop talking to her and how during our issues she has been and is the only women hes gone behind my back with but on a friendship level because shes miles away he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like hes possibly in love with her too he said he feels like hes in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him and she hasnt been able to leave him alone since even though she knows that hes still with me and happy with our family she cant help it and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual being that he loves me too he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time he wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels but he didnt want me to find out so he told me everything he said he didnt want to continue to lie to me and so i can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when its only been this one girl the whole time he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her and that no matter what he did to do right i would still accuse him hes caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesnt want me to leave him because im the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life
   im of course hurt and in shock i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away both of these decisions are really hard to make because i feel like whether i stay or go my heart will still be torn apart i have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than i thought",intimacy,hi jayuya im struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cant do that and i dont think either of those things will help you id like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe do you have supports do your family and friends know whats happening in your life have you ever been to a womens shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly thats what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best
1710,what can i do if there is no trust in our relationship,i just got married with my husband i have four kids of my own and he accepts me with my kids i am thankful he loves my kids even though theyre not his now we are having problems in our relationship because of my past i know all marriages have problems but sometimes i feel its not going to work out if theres no trust its hard for me to let go because i love him but i am getting tired,intimacy,hi louisianayou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past you dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshiptrust is the first stage in a relationship moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element but you didnt see this coming did you thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface i give you credit for wanting it to work and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust good luck
1711,im scared of hurting my boyfriend after he had a cyst removed from his testicles,my boyfriend and i have not had sex in a couple of weeks he had to have a cyst removed on his testicles i have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him im scared to touch him and get close to him because im afraid that i will hurt him,intimacy,are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex againbeing able to talk together about topics that involve both of you will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional levelalso there are many ways of making love  if your bfs cyst hasnt yet healed then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions is to read about these together with himi hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another while developing more emotional closeness in the process

1718,any suggestions for erection problems,im a  year old male and having erection problems still have the desire for a woman awfully frustrated any suggestions my doc doesnt want to discuss it,intimacy,hi there first off i have to commend you for reaching out it takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems believe it or not this problem is very common for men and women there are some things that you can try naturally before resulting in medication such as your eating habits and exercise i would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly how much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily these are just a few common things to look at you would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies our bodies are like a car you have to maintenance it in order for it to continue to run if you would like to get further natural advice andor suggestions on eating healthy and exercising i would recommend you see a nutritionist a nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet as far as your doctor i would recommend looking into getting another doctor i have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything that appears to be a personal issue on their part i hope i was helpful and i wish you the best of luck
1719,my wife has a diminished libido and is faking orgasms and denying it what do i do,my wife and i are newly married about  months weve had some issues surrounding sex particularly her lack of libido shes on an anxiety medication of which diminished libido is a side effect but i think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacyromance centered around my hectic schedule our sex life has suffered as a result tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex which is a big deal once things started she had the most obviously fake orgasm ive ever encountered i was honest with her about why and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it she responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking i dont know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation i think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further please help,intimacy,you are newly married you have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication what if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another you know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  it turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments and have fun with it
1720,my wife and i have been married for over  years and were tired of having sex,we make love once per month is it normal,intimacy,to begin with whats normal for one couple isnt going to be normal for the next every couple has their own normal and thats important to keep in mind your sexual lives will ebb and flow what id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having id also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it here
1721,i tell my husband i love him but i dont believe it or feel it,when having sex i think of other men and want other men all day long been married  years together  what do you think,intimacy,sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be it sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together thats both common and confusing intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow resparking your passion will involve growing using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs security and wants desires marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required
1722,how do i deal with a weird fetish im afraid of opening up about,i have this weird fetish that im afraid to open up about it what should i do,intimacy,this is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is  i do understand that this is something that is bothering you though the first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not  if this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urgeshowever if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings  you may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of  you may find other people have the same interest as you  find a therapist that you can trust and tell them  dont hold back with your therapist  trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are  there is no need to suffer with this alone
1723,what should i do if my boyfriend cant get over my past,my boyfriend cant get over my promiscuous past he says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction he says he should have had more sex with different people i dont know how to handle this,intimacy,i am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history for one thing it is a good idea to be checked for stds before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do this gets into a gray area for some people i dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and i certainly dont want a whole lot of details sometimes that is an image i just dont want in my head about my partner vague details are usually enoughhowever i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past this is a reflection on him not you this shows insecurities on his part you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship you can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you i have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity it takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though if your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment i dont see that you have done anything wrong if you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you it is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be in time the right person for you will enter your life
1724,im losing my husband because my lack of sex drive,"i have no sex drive due to medical issues ive shut down completely and closed everyone out ive even told my husband that i wanted a divorce since thats what i thought he wanted to hear however it devastated me when i learned hes seeing someone else
 ive since told him that i wanted to work things out but hes not sure i actually mean it he thinks the only reason i want him back is because im jealous how do i show him im serious",intimacy,im sorry to hear about your current situation my heart goes out to you during this timefirst of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing more than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptomssecondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling i think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being himif you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship the conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial and please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof was not your faultbest of luck to you and your husband

1744,how do i deal with the pain of losing my baby,,griefandloss,recognize and allow yourself to know your feelings  and let this process take as long as it naturally requires  you wont feel this way forever and the feelings will dissolve by themselves once youve accepted themalso take good care of your physical self during your grieving time   grieving usually means people withdraw themselves from everyday life as much as possiblewhile emotionally it is necessary to primarily care about knowing your recent loss matters monitor yourself to eat properly keep your house in good shape wash your clothes and take care of your personal hygieneotherwise it is possible to get overwhelmed from your own selfneglect of daily lifefinally too a major loss such as you have is a time for reflection and reevaluation of overall life happiness and directionlet yourself know more about who you are and in which direction youd like to go as your grief feels more manageable and you regain interest in everyday life
1745,how do i deal with the pain of losing my baby,,griefandloss,im so sorry for your loss  here are some things that i know have worked for other parents following the loss of their babies allow yourself to feel all your feelings no matter how big or scary they may be find ways to memorialize the baby now and in the future and dont put a time limit on your grief  it isnt a linear process so you will have days that make you feel like you did the moment you experienced the loss  on other days you will feel better and may not even think about the baby  i hope you have a really good support system and at least one trusted person you can share your thoughts and feelings with without any judgment  if you dont i know parents have found comfort in journaling or blogging as ways to express themselves  im glad you have reached out for help  im wishing you well
1746,how do i deal with the pain of losing my baby,,griefandloss,first im very sorry that this has happenedwith just the information that you mentioned im not sure whether you mean that you lost your baby through miscarriage stillbirth very young after being born or several years into your childs life while the process of working through your loss would certainly have similar components no matter how old your baby was there are some differences as wellin general i would suggest that you find more than one person in your life who you can trust to talk with about your feelings if you have no one or would prefer to talk to someone who was not as close to you in that sense consider speaking with a mental health professionalthere is quite a process to grieving and it certainly takes time its different for everyone and the timetable is different for everyoneheres a link to some information about some tasks of grieving this is very general information and it would likely be helpful to work through it with someone httptherapychangescomblogreviewwordensfourtasksofgrievingi dont know how long ago you lost your baby but it may also be helpful to look at what remains that you do have control over for example i imagine that you choose what you want to eat how you want to dress whether or not to go to school or work etc while im sure your routine is quite different than it was before your loss consider establishing a basic routine for daily activitiesalso depending upon the age of your child you could probably find a local support grouphaving pain after losing your baby is quite typical and is a reflection of how important your baby was and still is to you if you feel as though you are going through this alone or without the type of support that you want it is possible to be surrounded by people and still feel alone consider finding some effective support as an important beginning step reaching out here is certainly the beginning of that

1751,why cant i stop crying,my grandma and brother both passed away  years ago and sometimes at night i just cant stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but wont have ever again i cant sleep at night when the memories and tears come ill be fine all day then at nightboom its like waterfalls from my eyes why cant i stop crying,griefandloss,its good to know you are reminiscing about good memories  the sadness and crying is normal when you are missing a loved one  you are noticing that grief changes it doesnt just stop  you have recognized that there will be moments in life that you will want to have shared with your brother and grandma and it just seems unfair that you cannot  i often find that when someone is stuck in the place you are it is a result of unfinished business and in your case it appears unfinished futures  a professional versed in grieving and its intricacies can guide you to navigate through this and lessen the intensity that you experience  as life goes on there will be many moments that you will have wished they were present but those moments do not have to bring you such intense emotion  seek some help you wont regret it

1753,i lost my mom and i feel like im depressed,last year i just always felt hopeless i dont have a great relationship with my sister i lost my mother recently and that really added to my sadness my sister always brings up how i was never close to my mother,griefandloss,i am so sorry about your loss  losing someone you love is always difficult however losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life  what makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister  it is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided but what i suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you  it is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way  by her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion  only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother  if there is truth to this then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor   there could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will  you and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle  when two people are grieving the same loss at the same time it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle even if they both were on good terms with each other  depression is part of the cycle of grief  it is absolutely normal to feel sad as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms ie feelings of isolation lack of motivation low energy sleep or appetite changes etc  anger is another phase of the grief cycle  your sister may be stuck in the anger phase not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grieffinally it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated  were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss  depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder  depression can be situational ie triggered by an event or related to genetics undiagnosed health issues stress trauma or other potential risk factors  if you have a family history of depression you are more susceptible to have depression  it would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider and if necessary get treatment through counseling and medical interventions
1754,i lost my mom and i feel like im depressed,last year i just always felt hopeless i dont have a great relationship with my sister i lost my mother recently and that really added to my sadness my sister always brings up how i was never close to my mother,griefandloss,wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationshipswhat they could have been never were and what was lost with death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while or longer i hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your moms passing i also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time as long as you need to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister

   i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substanceabuse,hi good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself thats a great first step its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionfor the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if im on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually ill give in and eat ityoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette thats normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought thats what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it ok i kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itbest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby

   i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substanceabuse,its very admirable that you are trying to stop smoking for the sake of your health and your childs health  the mental aspect of quitting a drug can and usually is the hardest part  first it can be helpful to change the focus of your thinking so you are focusing on the healthy behaviors you will startimprove rather than only focusing on the behavior that you are trying to stop  the reason for this is that our brains hear the main topic of our thoughts  that is when you tell yourself quit smoking quit smoking quit smoking your brain hears smoking smoking smoking  so we need to put together a selfcare plan that addresses your thinking emotions and behaviors nutrition physical activity and other stress reducing activities  the idea is to have an effective plan in place to both prevent yourself from feeling intense stress which increases cravings and to have a wellplaced plan for when the intense cravings inevitably present themselves  and lastly and possibly the most important you have to believe you deserve to be the healthiest version of yourself  think about the times when you are most vulnerable to smoke stressful situations after meals when drinking social situations etc  the use of affirmations is also an important resource as what we say to ourselves effects our mood  repeatedly telling yourself i am healthy i am getting healthier my lungs are becoming clear and healthy or other affirmations like this  even if you dont believe them at first continue saying them  this step is important to improve cognitive flexibility which trains your brain to be open to change  think about activities that you like to do or that you would like to try and replace smoking with those activities  any activity that can make you laugh time with friends watching comedies etc will evoke a calming response because when we feel happy we typically dont feel stressed out simultaneously

   i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substanceabuse,breaking any habit is no easy feat   cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging and there arent any one size fits all solutions  fortunately there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking   many habits that we have are paired habits if we do one thing then we will do the other thing  think about the activities that you do when smoking and try to pair those activities with another activity other than smoking  for instance many people smoke while they drive  consider planning another activity to do while driving it might not be driving for you but you get the idea   it might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work    create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break  this approach could be used in a variety of different ways  if you smoke first thing in the morning consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home  walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke   leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes  with this strategy you are trying to create some distance between you the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them    consider cutting back before cutting out  if you are smoking  cigarettes a day try smoking  then cut back to  and so on  having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether   you could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches if you arent already pregnant this could be a great resource to help boost your success   focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are loosing you may be losing cigarettes but you are gaining money health taste buds an increased sense of smell lung capacity a healthy baby etc  you could plan small rewards treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases  i recommend making these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road  good luck cutting out cigarettes will be good for you and your baby

   i cannot help myself from thinking about smoking what can i do to get rid of this addiction",substanceabuse,quitting smoking can be difficult its also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way from the way that you wrote this it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically but still have cravingsone thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or obgyn about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings sometimes that can very helpfulas far as the more emotional or mental piece these things come to mindsometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy there are sometimes toys like those available at office playground that may help to keep you physically occupiedthere can also be changes or additions to your routine because i imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead the list is endless but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise with the permission of your doctor just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well completing a puzzle learning a new activity that requires using your hands painting or knitting perhapsanother piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes perhaps irritability depending on what it is that you may be feeling  learning other strategies to use can be helpful as wellthis can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change i would recommend that if things do not become easier for you consider talking with a therapist then you could not only have some more strategies or ideas directly related to you but you could have very direct support for what you are trying to doi give you a lot of credit

1794,what can i do to help my dad stop drinking,or how to send him somewhere that can help him something like the baker act,substanceabuse,your dad needs to be aware that he has a problem and be willing to make some changes in order for him to be motivated to stop  often times individuals will be forced to stop when they were not ready  remember we can not ever make someone do something they do not want to do  there needs to be at least a little willingness on the other party to make some changes  i would encourage you to reach out to your family or other loved ones and have a conversation with your dad regarding your concerns
1795,i dont know if my exboyfriend is using opiates again,my boyfriend and i recently broke up one week we were fine and the next he told me he needed space he completely deleted me out of his life he does have an opiate addiction he claimed he was sober but since weve split ive heard many lies from him could he be using again and does this addiction affect the mind,substanceabuse,studies have proven that addiction affects the brain there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well  i would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns  not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals  being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationships
1796,is it okay if i take my friends pills away,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,substanceabuse,your friend needs to admit they have a problem  if not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more  it is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested  in other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them  like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways  i would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation  encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her
1797,is it okay if i take my friends pills away,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,substanceabuse,your good intentions to help your friend stay clean are very caring about herunless your friend feels like stopping pills  taking them away will mean she finds them some place elsethe problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax physically addictedtaking pills has basically become a standard part of your friends lifeher problem is bigger than your ability to careif you havent already done so tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pillsthis is not a guarantee that shell stopit isa way of you showing that you care about heroffering love and advice are the only things you can do for hermeanwhile knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting yoube sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself  offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using
1798,is it okay if i take my friends pills away,my friend is abusing her prescription medicine even though she told me she didnt have any more pills i found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications,substanceabuse,hello thank you for your question i have a worked with many people who have become addicted to benzodiazepines like clonazepam it is a difficult road for people who are trying to become clean it is also a very difficult road for those who love the person and are trying to be supportive during those times it is important to remember to take care of yourself too as for taking your friends pills my concern would be the legal ramifications that you could face should you ever be caught with someone elses prescription medication and especially these types of medications our laws have become much more strict surrounding prescription drug sales and possession due to the increase in prescription drug abuse in addition people who are in active addiction are likely to find some other means to get their drug so it would do little to help the overall problem i dont know about your friends family situation but they may be a better route to take if you are concerned about your friend they may already be involved but with your help you may be able to convince your friend to go to treatment willingly that is usually better in many states there are also involuntary committal processes where a persons family may be able to convince a court to force the person into treatment this varies from state to state if your friends family is not aware of this option it may be something to look into it usually does take a relative or a medical provider to begin this process if it is available i hope this was helpful and i wish you and your friend well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

1802,how can i stop abusing alcohol,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,substanceabuse,anyone who wants to change their life path eventually will be successful in this  how to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional painthe basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed  almost always addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored humiliated shamed invisible nothing very pleasant since a very young age usually starting around  monthsmost often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their familywith no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outletso people mask and numb by substances whether this is food chocolate work alcohol weedtherapy that is humanistic based is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis orientedif youd like getting serious about knowing who you are including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years you can do thisonce you have a stronger selfrespect and awareness you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people  harming oneself is the opposite of selfrespectalso about your diagnosis it may not be true at all  the us healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugssee if you can find a therapist who is independent minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something wrongthis simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first placegood luck
1803,how can i stop abusing alcohol,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,substanceabuse,this relationship with your step dad sounds very challenging it is hard to to be told over and over again how not good enough we are let me offer you this frequently when we say harsh mean nasty things to others we are simply projecting our own thoughts about ourself i am not advocating that this is ok it seems like your stepdad could also use some support you get to make your own empowered choice around this this is your life and if you find yourself in a situation that does not suit you make a change
1804,how can i stop abusing alcohol,i have bipolar ii disorder im addicted to alcohol and weed and im hopeless i keep drinking even though its harming myself and others,substanceabuse,the first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change  frequently our problems keep us in denial  although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone  the best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together  alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction  know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed i really recommend an inpatient stay for at least  days for anyone who is dealing with addiction whether combined with mental health issues or not  if this is not a possibility then the next best thing would be an intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues  know that there is hope for what you are experiencing  you can get control over these issues  the next step is finding the team andor facility that is going to help you do it

1834,how can i avoid family members who stress me out,my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned she calls me every day complaining but i dont want to hear it anymore,familyconflict,it is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece you cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being abandoned not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself it is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support in this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain this must be very difficult for you because i hear the stress in your voice almost everyday its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed i feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance when empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional helpafter sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you this means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed this could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite you could then say to her if she complains again i cannot change the way you feel in this situation and i encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what i could do is explain what you could do to helpwwwpsychologyresourceca

1843,how can i avoid family members who stress me out,my mother takes care of niece whom my sister abandoned she calls me every day complaining but i dont want to hear it anymore,familyconflict,it sounds as though there is a need to establish some healthy boundaries with your mother simply put a boundary is a line or space between you and another person it is also a way of defining what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable when working with clients i teach them that there are  rules to setting healthy boundaries first the boundary must be clear and definable think of a boundary like lines on a football field the other person needs to know when they are in bounds or if they have stepped out of bounds second the other person must be told about the boundary its not fair for me to enforce a consequence if ive never told you about the boundary third there must be a consequence for violating the boundary this is often the place where people struggle its important to identify a consequence that is appropriate and proportionate to the violation finally the fourth and most important rule is if you are not willing to follow rule  dont bother with any of this the reason the fourth rule is so important is that if someone violates my boundary and i refuse to enforce the consequence ive basically told them that my boundaries mean nothing you are well within your rights to establish a boundary with your mother you are not her therapist remember to communicate your boundary to her in a way that is clear and unambiguous also make sure that you enforce the consequence in the event that she doesnt adhere to your boundaries

1853,what can i do about my family not accepting me as bisexual,after i told them they yelled at me,familyconflict,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family i truly wish i could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately i cant do that their acceptance of you is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen so here are a few things i would suggestsurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are that wont take the place of your familys acceptance and i wont even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most and that is really important patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some when families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock and then sometimes even grieving they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden these things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience if it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away i do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around they may or they may not and if they dont you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that if you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with counselor may be a great idea i am bias probably but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good idea  hope this helps be well be you robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

1864,what can i do about my family not accepting me as bisexual,after i told them they yelled at me,familyconflict,im sorry your family had such an upsetting response to your newsmaybe eventually they will come around to greater acceptance of you   if this was the first time they heard this fact about your sexuality the information may have overwhelmed themit is up to the family members now to realize they handled their reaction in a way which may have upset youwhether or not they do this you still can be sure you did what was necessary and in your hands to tell them such key information about you
1865,what can i do about my family not accepting me as bisexual,after i told them they yelled at me,familyconflict,there are a lot of ways one could go about handling this kind of conflict it is hard to know which way might be advisable if we dont know quite why they would yell or why would they care who you choose to sleep andor partner with to begin withhowever it is of utmost important that you accept yourself as bisexual and sometimes that is easier said than done but when you are able to get to that acceptance that you are not in the majority in society as far as sexual orientation goes and all that comes with that and perhaps other issues you might have with it it will be significantly easier for you to tolerate your familys lack of acceptance and perhaps chalk it up to a severe lack of openmindednessbut because it is family and we dont choose our families but are forced to deal with them for the most part for better or worse admittedly im not the biggest fan of outright estrangement processing the loss of the family that i hoped i had will also be important for you moving forward in your life you likely will be able to realize you dont need them to accept your sexual orientation for you to live a healthy and happy life perhaps when they see that they cant change you they will actually just learn to accept it
1866,is it okay to date my exboyfriends cousin,i have been dating my exboyfriends cousin for a few years we have gotten pretty serious he wants to cut it off because people are giving him a hard time that our kids will be related to my ex,familyconflict,does your boyfriend agree with the other peoples opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he doesnt like hearingtalk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering himonce the two of you understand what if any the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status youll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow
1867,how can i deal with the stress of my mother,my mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though im in my s she argues with me over stupid stuff,familyconflict,this sounds like a pretty difficult dynamic and i am sorry to hear how it is impacting youi would encourage you to try and observe the relationship from an outside perspective to begin with  try to see what it is that causes your mom to be upset such as you responding in a tone of voice she doesnt like and see if there is something you could change on your end  if you are able to change something like your tone of voice start there  you could also try asking what you could do to help perhaps she is frustrated that the trash wasnt taken out  you could also sit down and try to hash things out with her if you feel like that could be beneficialultimately you are only in charge of you  the things you say your behaviors are all controlled by you  so it is important to recognize that no matter what you cant control what she says or does  obviously the things we say or do can impact others which is why you are frustrated over her behavior  but remember that you are able to only control yourself  seeking therapeutic intervention could also be beneficial for you and even having her join in to help  i hope you are able to figure something out and i wish you well
1868,how can i deal with the stress of my mother,my mom is always bossy and treats me like a child even though im in my s she argues with me over stupid stuff,familyconflict,this is a common issue you grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance im all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom ultimately you only have control over yourself so thats the place to start you can remind yourself that moms behaviours dont mean that she doesnt trust you or love you its just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range if you can see her responses as habits rather than a reflection of how she feels about you then you can keep yourself calm the more calm you are the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship take a look at the picture from her perspective she may feel overwhelmed with finances are you in college and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesnt know how to recruit help for i bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundryall those thankless mom tasks take a look at how she talks to you is she nagging about chores can you see that underneath the nagging theres a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance  okay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef she wants help you want respect lets talk about how you get bothi propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic momi see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want sell it as winwin then you write down some things that end up forming a contract the first part is stuff thats your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene moms voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and its a health hazard this is a mom says nothing about list the second part is about what mom needs from you what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult does she want you to contribute to rent buy your own food do your own laundry what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom how will these things be enforced what will happen if you dont follow through write it all down so its really clear it has to all be mutually agreed uponthe third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her you can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre  years old listen to what she wants too beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect youd be more willing to help out and i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less go for the winwin i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom 
1869,how am i supposed to feel when i forgive someone,my mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back and i cant seem to forgive her i want to say that its okay but i cant i feel like even if i did forgive her i wouldnt be able to say it to her face,familyconflict,how someone feels when they forgive another is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong who was responsible for what in the situation and clarity on their own motivation actions emotions including pain regret resentment sadnessthese steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either persons way of handling themselvesthe long answer would be that youre not yet through with this processi commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourselfyoure on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when youve reached resolution and not beforefinding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention sometimes is a frustration of its ownkeep up your good work of knowing your own lifeit is a worthwhile endeavor

1871,escalating disagreements between mother and wife,"my wife and mother are having tense disagreements in the past theyve had minor differences for example my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing my mother would complain my wife is lazy
 however its intensified lately i think the cause is my wife talked back to her once now any little disagreement is magnified leading to major disagreements what can i do",familyconflict,what you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead you have been triangulated by your wife and motherthis is often seen in families its seen everywhere how many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain it is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential for example i bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaintim not saying triangulation is always a bad thing sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree thats what therapists do every day sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer however in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveif you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife i heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren if your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have from your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to if you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike i am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them they will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should in worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship change the dynamics before it spirals even further

1882,how can i tell my dad im a femaletomale transgender and i want to start binding,i have known i was always different this year in december i found out that i never felt female i did research and have identified myself as male but dont know how to tell my dad,familyconflict,hello and thank you for your question this is certainly a tough spot i have a few thoughts and perhaps some colleagues will add some things you may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues or if you have ever heard him talk about it that may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you for example if he has been watching the news lately transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot has he had an opinion this wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people to tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you there is no right or wrong way best or worst if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him thats perfect want to have a friend with you for support equally perfect whatever thing you need to do and of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so unfortunately the response from your dad cant be predicted some parents are totally cool others not so much this is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea if things get heated you have someone in your corner there are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him you can also google some stories about how others came outi refer many people to the wwwletsqueerthingsupcom blog it is a popular blog written by a trans man that i know he writes on many topics related to trans issues hope some of these suggestions help be well be you and good luckrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

   i get so depressed because of my dads yelling he keeps asking me why i cant just be happy the way i am and yells at me on a daily basis is this considered emotional abuse",familyconflict,maybe this is emotional abuseit certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourselfmaybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your gendertheres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this  only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him

 once the relationship was over she became extremely abusive and has attempted to intimidate me into silence regarding the many false claims made on her immigration application",familyconflict,im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wifeon the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful timemaybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for exampleconsider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person   your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behaviortheres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventurestheres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again  the first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship   there is no designated time line  youll simply feel more ready than you feel nowvery unlikely that youd ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one youre currently recovering fromgood luck

1921,im scared to tell my family that im bisexual,my parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay when they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual i dont know if i am ready to come out to them,familyconflict,"hello and thank you for your question being bisexual can be particularly
difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are supposed
to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays it happens so
often that there is actually a term for it  
bierasure this is simply something that happens when people deny that
bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs
like your parents seem to have 
the unfortunate truth is that you can never
be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information it sounds
promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may
simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality with accurate
information they may come around but there is no way to be sure 
some of my colleagues have already given you good information here are some more things that you can consider
and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them
 
      if they dont respond the way you want them to have you developed a support
system to support you through it this is very important the truth is that all
the friends in the world wont prevent pain or sadness if your parents dont
respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you are
okay as you are and that is critical for you to remember 
 
      there is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can
offer your parents if you think it would be helpful it may be important for
them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young
people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality here is an article from
glaad about bierasure httpwwwglaadorgbisexualbierasure
 
      coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take
place when you are ready sometimes people get pressured from friends media
and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are
ready it really is up to you if you are feeling pressure from others dont
feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out
on your own time intimate partners should respect you enough to understand
this 
 
      something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual just
because someone is lgbtq doesnt mean that they necessarily want to be many
people struggle with this having
your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are
in telling your parents so perhaps do some selfexploration about your
feelings toward yourself 
 
sometimes people take friends with them
when they decide to come out to their parents this is something you may want
to consider the important thing to remember is that you are okay really if
your parents dont respond well that doesnt mean that they never will some
start off upset but then work their way through it 
best of luck to you

1922,im scared to tell my family that im bisexual,my parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay when they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual i dont know if i am ready to come out to them,familyconflict,coming out to family members can cause a lot of anxiety however  although i cannot promise what their reaction will be the benefit is that you will no longer have to hide who you are perhaps researching or getting information on bisexuality can help your family understand what it truly is to be bisexual many times  people are just not educated on certain things
1923,im scared to tell my family that im bisexual,my parents seem okay with other sexualities but normally they only talk about being gay when they do talk about bisexuality they say things like theyll do anything or things that make me very uncomfortable because i am bisexual i dont know if i am ready to come out to them,familyconflict,perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents  often times our readiness is not dependent on what others will say or how they react but more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others reactions  it may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion eg your parents being supportive vs your parents being disappointed and so on how are you prepared to deal with the outcome  you may also seek help through counselors support groups andor individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents  all the best
1924,how do i tell my parents that im gay,im in love with my own gender and my parents are against that i dont know how to tell them because im afraid theyll not want me anymore,familyconflict,hello and thank you for your question this is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly but unfortunately i cant do that there is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them the truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways some have told their parents directly some drop hints some have had others tell their parents etc the only right way to come out is the one that you choose the one that feels right to you that is the best way some people decide not to come out and some wait for a very long time both of these things are okay coming out is deeply personal and there can be real consequences to someones emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person that is why it should only be done when you are ready when you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk sometimes people can feel pressured to come out but i encourage you to do it in your own time the truth is there is a spectrum of how peoples parents react to this kind of news on one end you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a coming out party most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle it is important to remember that their feelings may change over time many parents struggle at first but they love their kids and get better with it over time if you decide to tell them consider taking someone along to support you plan ahead on what you want to say it can be an emotional time so do what you need to do to take care of yourself if you need to leave you dont have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you i wish you well and good luckrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
1925,how do i handle all of my stress,i work two jobs and go to school for criminal justice over the summer my father had a stroke it was very devastating my father isnt the same and my family fights every day i have been kicked out the house many times i break down a lot,familyconflict,you undoubtedly are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father family conflict as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule stress if left unchecked has many negative health related implications first and foremost i would recommend going to see a counselor at your collegeuniversity most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for  free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them secondly i would advise you to take a minute and breathe when confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress when dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care in other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace enjoyment and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress it is inevitable and a part of life but how you deal with stress as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life i hope this helps
1926,what should i do if i found out one of my parents are cheating,i saw my mother cheating on my dad before i said something to her and she said it was in the past yesterday i saw her texting dirty things to the same guy should i talk to her again i dont want my parents to go their separate ways i just want her to stop its not fair,familyconflict,you as the child in the middle of your parents problems is the worse position to be in  i can only imagine your hurt pain and confusion on what to do  honestly this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age your parents ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end  one thing i would like to noteyour parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating they have already gone their separate ways
1927,how can i be more open and honest with my dad,i avoid talking to him because he always makes me more upset i cant be honest with him about anything because he is always rude to me,familyconflict,hi troy i totally get this its a dilemma you want your dad to know how hes hurting you but you dont feel safe enough to say anything to him your reaction is understandable its his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open but thats not who your dad is your dad is your dad and waiting for him to change wont really help nothing you do can change your dad butthere are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him while your response of avoiding him is understandable i wonder what effect it has on your dad its possible that hes feeling frustrated rejected and punished by your withdrawal you may think he knows that youre feeling hurt but he probably doesnt so this is the squirrel chasing its tail your dad is rude so your habit is to be silent then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated his frustration comes out as more rudeness which makes you want to withdraw more and the cycle starts all over again you cant change his part of the cycle but you can change yoursare you willing to take a risk can you be honest about how youre feeling whats the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad you know why i avoid you i stay silent because when i talk to you say rude things so if you want me to talk i need to know you can listen i imagine it would come out differently because youre a few generations younger than me but put that into your own wordsi dont know the level of your dads rudeness if he is abusive then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this i dont want to put you at any risk but if you dont worry your dad will hurt you maybe give honesty a trymy point is that as rude as your dad may be checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude its powerfulyour silence your dad cant read your mind and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with himand if youre both open to it seeing a therapist together can be really helpful 
1928,im in a lesbian relationship and my mother doesnt really approve,,familyconflict,it can be very difficult when our parents do not approve of significant aspects of who we are as children we need our parents approval and as adults we often still desire it some things i am wondering about are how do you feel about your sexuality and your relationship with your mother is there anything you would like to have different in your relationship with your mother i dont know if these questions resonate with you or not but if there are some conflicted feelings in regards to your mother working with a competent therapist may be a good way of getting clarity about how you would like to move forward

1931,can a person be mean towards another person if that person was treated poorly before,i keep being mean to my best friend and i dont know why all the time i did come to maybe some kind of conclusion that it is because my mother is mean to me all the time could that be a cause,familyconflict,hi morristowntheres a saying that goes hurt people hurt people its possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mothers behaviours when we are treated poorly especially as children it affects how we ourselves others and the world its also powerful modelling of aggressive behaviour the good news is that you have this lovely awareness and i think a desire to learn about yourself and grow in your ability to be respectful to people you care about i recommend you consider sitting down with a therapist and exploring these ideas and moving forward on that path you seem to want to be on good luck
1932,how can i have a better relationship with my mom,my mom and i have been fighting a lot now and i just want a good relationship with her,familyconflict,the best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively  one of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response  often the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication the hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times
1933,my brother never hangs out with me anymore,i am a teenager and my brother is a few years older he has a girlfriend who is always with him he never hangs out with me anymore we were really close and it is making me really sad,familyconflict,hi zionsville its so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother you will always have that you know hes doing whats natural at his agespreading his wings and looking for love you may be heading into that zone soon too but i get that its weird that hes there before you and you miss himtry to respect your brothers autonomy wish him well be friendly with his girlfriend and its also okay to say hey bro im still here when can we hang out
1934,my brother never hangs out with me anymore,i am a teenager and my brother is a few years older he has a girlfriend who is always with him he never hangs out with me anymore we were really close and it is making me really sad,familyconflict,it is always hard when we feel as if we are losing somebody close to us feeling sad over these losses are normal while there may be some things you can do to remedy this situation it is important that you try and understand that part of life is change the fact that your brother doesnt spend as much time with you doesnt mean that he loves you less or doesnt care about you it most likely means that he is having to split his time between different people and priorities i suggest that you communicate with him how you feel perhaps ask him if he would be able to set up times that the two of you can hang out without anyone else present addionally it wouldnt hurt for you to also find some other ways to spend your time away from him now might be the perfect opportunity to pick up a new hobby or hang out with different peers keeping yourself distracted in healthy ways and processing your feelings of sadness will likely help with lifting your mood good luck to you
1935,my husband doesnt include me in the family,ive been hurt by a man for five years he doesnt involve me with the family or kids everyone in the family is against me there is a mass today for a family member and he never asked me to go im to sit home alone now and christmas too he expects me to sit alone while he enjoys being with the family we are in our s and it hurts that he wont even think of me or involve me as part of the family he doesnt even care i am leaving him as soon as possible but i hurt so bad that i didnt know who to turn too im now in this low funk of depression and im scared because i do stupid things to myself and give up i have no friends because i was a truck driver ive been getting serious headaches and cant sleep i dont eat ive lost my appetite this has been going on for a couple weeks now,familyconflict,hi floridai get the sense that aside from this relationship youre quite isolated in general its sad that youre feeling excluded at christmastime and family events while i would suggest that you dont really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling you assume theyre against you and that he doesnt care he is certainly behaving in a very distant excluding manner and its understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt how long has this part been happening has he always acted this way or is it more recent did something happen recently you mentioned doing stupid things to yourself and i dont know what that means if you are engaging in selfharm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this part of the problem of course is that you dont know whats going on for him certainly you deserve the truth and if he doesnt want to spend time with you i would hope he would be honest have you been open to hearing the truth from him is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why hes being distant maybe you could ask him if you are ready to hearim glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full loving relationship although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man im just guessing based on what youve said here  it seems that its possible your situation has led to some depression and i would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out you will need support even if the relationship is repaired best of luck
1936,what do i do about a cousin who makes me feel belittled insecure and frustrated,hello i have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled insecure and frustrated during her stay here in the city i know she comes from a place of love but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate negative oblivious and self consumed    i have tried to talk to her openly about this but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful spatially aware of surroundingspeople or positive but in the end i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship    what can i do,familyconflict,do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does if they dont see these qualities in you then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you you can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are its her issue and she is not coming from a place of loveeven if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love the fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you
1937,what do i do about a cousin who makes me feel belittled insecure and frustrated,hello i have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled insecure and frustrated during her stay here in the city i know she comes from a place of love but she has always been shortfused and highly temperamental if something doesnt work out the way she planned it i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include inconsiderate negative oblivious and self consumed    i have tried to talk to her openly about this but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful spatially aware of surroundingspeople or positive but in the end i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship    what can i do,familyconflict,it sounds like you are feeling pretty criticized by your cousin and at the same time you are wondering whether or not there is some truth in what she is saying it also sounds like you would like to see if you can find a new way to relate to your cousin so that your relationship can be more satisfying if you can find a competent therapist to work with there may be a great deal of opportunity to learn more about how you relate to people in the world and to learn strategies to show up in your relationship with your cousin in a way that feels right to you
1938,i lie to my mom about my relationship,i use to be so happy no matter what i always was happy i got into a relationship with this guy i love him so much were both teenagers the week after his birthday my mom made me stop talking to him it broke me he came to my house and talked to her and she let us date again but not see each other he comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that i have to lie to her,familyconflict,i understand that this can be difficult when you care about someone have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other and what her concerns are it sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating and compromising it is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having  to lie to your mom it  would be helpful if she could understand that you having to lie to he is getting in the way of you being able to go to her with any issue and  feel she will hopefully understand or try to understand where you are coming from  have either one of you been in family therapy this may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from if your mood is sad and your feeling worse it is important that you reach out to an adult parent person at school whom you trust to share your feelings and help you feel understood and work through your problems
1939,i lie to my mom about my relationship,i use to be so happy no matter what i always was happy i got into a relationship with this guy i love him so much were both teenagers the week after his birthday my mom made me stop talking to him it broke me he came to my house and talked to her and she let us date again but not see each other he comes up to my school every day and it tears me apart that i have to lie to her,familyconflict,hi los angeles i can tell you have a moral backbone because its hurting you to lie to your mom i always say that a little bit of guilt is healthy because it teaches us who we want to be listen to that voice you dont have to lie to your mom to get what you wantnow you dont say how old you are so part of my answer is going to be a bit vague theres a big difference between being thirteen and your mom telling you what to do and being nineteen and your mom telling you what to do the thing is that moms and dads start out making all your decisions for you when youre small and theyre supposed to very gradually give that control over to you different parents do this at different speeds but in general you have to earn that freedom and trustits not just gonna be handed over to you you might not like this partyour parent has the right to make the rules my guess is theres a reason why mom is holding you back even if it doesnt make sense to you breaking her rules isnt going to get you what you wantwhich is freedom right i guarantee you that mom wants you to eventually earn freedombut shes not supposed to give it to you until youre ready because her first job is to keep you safe i like that your mom has limits for you too many parents are sort of looking the other way busy with their own thing whether you know it or not you need protection like all kids do appropriate for your age of courseit sounds like what you want to say to your mom is i want to make my own decisions about who i spend time with thats a normal wish and i encourage you to say that to her depending on your age and whether youve earned it she might listen so youre sending her that message that you want to send but youre doing it in a sneaky way and thats not going to go well when she finds out its called passive aggressive when you say something with a sneaky behaviour rather than with words its not a very healthy way of sending a message because people feel disrespected my guess is that your best bet is to be honest with mom stop the sneaking around and come up with a detailed plan of how youre going to earn your freedomeventually she might listen to that
1940,my parents are threatening to send me away if i dont play basketball for a team i hate,im applying to private high schools im playing basketball on my school team currently and i love it i also play on a team that ive hated since the beginning and i finally want to quit before the season gets started however my parents say i can play on either both teams or neither i think its unfair because its up to me if i want to play for a certain team i was planning on playing basketball for the high school i get into but if that means continuing to play for the team i hate then i wouldnt want to play in high school now i dont know what to do my parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if i dont play i just want to run away,familyconflict,the situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on youare you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standardare your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hateif yes then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiateif none of the above is possible then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist whom youd trust and feel safe in talkingi hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept
1941,how can i have a better relationship with my father,i am always arguing with my father he gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling i get upset often at this am i too sensitive he always says i am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings no matter how often i try to tell him this he never listens,familyconflict,thanks for the question regardless of whether or not you are sensitive it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you when we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed it is difficult to not take it personally it sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context begin your statements with i as opposed to you for example you can tell him i feel angry when you raise your voice at me instead of you always yell at me also avoid using black and white terms such as never and always additionally offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you maybe he just doesnt know how to lastly when delivering a message i like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive for example you may say something to the effect ofdad i enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion there are times that i feel angry when you talk to me aggressively perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when i bring up heated topics lets try and work on this together i will try to be less sensitive and i am asking that you be more calmi hope you find this useful
1942,my exboyfriend wouldnt let me have my daughter because i didnt know my stepdaughters pickup details,"i am constantly having problems with the same two people who will always be in my life i had a daughter with my exboyfriend i am now married and my husbands exgirlfriend is involved with my exboyfriend they also have a daughter together my issue is that there is always drama i am pregnant and i told my exboyfriend that i dont want any drama or arguments i want to get along as much as possible and he agreed however we just had an incident where my exboyfriend started discussing dropoff details about my stepdaughter i told him that he needed to ask my husband because i cant make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter that led to an argument i told him all my concern is when i pick up my daughter my stepdaughters pickup details are between my husband and his exgirlfriend i especially told him i didnt want to be involved somehow he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on he threatened me and got ugly because i wouldnt discuss my stepdaughters matters with him
   the point is there is so much drama i try my best to get along with everyone i dont understand where i went wrong besides replying back to his question i feel like im going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyones frustrations are taken out on each other and its the children that are hurting i had a party planned for my daughters birthday and my exboyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldnt let me have her in my eyes its the child that is hurting i was throwing a party for her birthday and because of the problem with stupid pickup details about my stepdaughter which i have no control over he took it out on our daughter",familyconflict,hi i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing your exboyfriend seems more focused on his own needs in fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation i agree this is a problemi also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress honour this instinct you have i will suggest a few things to you first to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter it will help you feel supportedknow that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him you cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationkeep on defining clear boundaries you might sound like a broken record youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable its okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryregarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states x and you are not following our agreement your daughter doesnt have to be aware i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflicta professional therapist can help you with all of this i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself 
1943,why does my mom show more love to my brothers than me,she treats me like im not in her presence shes always yelling at me for no reason she gives more respect to my brothers than me but only my brothers fight her while i respect her,familyconflict,attention is not equal to love and being valued it may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your moms attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them it is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who dont demand as much attention end up feeling invisible it sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you  this sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out
1944,some adult family members are acting erratically in my house,"i am having a problem with extended family members who are inappropriately urinating in my home they are peeing in cat litter boxes bottles and directly on floors and in corners of my house
 is there any literature that supports why such adults would behave this way this is not a joke i am trying to understand",familyconflict,hi this sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out my first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  as far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries be clear about the expectations of your home also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue i hope this helps you your family members and the pets
1945,i had an affair almost two decades ago recently found out it resulted in a child,i am married to a beautiful lady i love my wife with all my heart we have  boys and i have a daughter from a previous marriage we also have  grandchildren now this event is tearing us apart i want our family to be together and happy it was a mistake from so long ago my wife wants to leave and i dont want that to happen i love her so much please help me save my marriage even my  boys want us to work it out they love us both and want our family together please give me some advice or hope sincerely heart broken,familyconflict,if your wife is willing seek out a qualified couples therapist look for one trained in the gottman method or emotionally focused therapy your relationship is repairable but you may need some qualified support in the process
1946,im in love with a sex offender but my family doesnt accept him,i started dating a guy i met online he told me that he registered sex offender but he didnt do anything he took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years that was more than two decades ago nothing on his record since i always believe the past should be left in past but my roommates their family and my son are unforgiving should i forgive this man that im falling in love with or should i dump him if i stay with him i will never see my family and granddaughter again,familyconflict,thank you for your question trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair from what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive if you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom we cannot control others but only ourselves respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship good luck to you
1947,how do i overcome being jealous of my boyfriends mother,,familyconflict,try to think of his close relationship with his mother in a good way it means that they have a positive family structure which can transfer down to your own family if you have one together in the future despite your boyfriend having a good relationship with his mother it will never be equal to the relationship that you have with him a love for a mother is a very different love than one with a girlfriend or wife there are certain things that he may look towards his mother for and certain things that he may look toward you for so instead of comparing your relationship with him to the one he has with his mother try viewing them as two separate entities she can not replace you and you cannot replace her however all together you can have a positive healthy family dynamic
1948,where does a child go for help,"im having issues with my relative the police never believe the experiences i have been through because i am only a kid 
   ive even had trouble trying to reach a therapist because i said i wanted to get an adult to help me could you please give me advice",familyconflict,i think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children its called the childhelp national child abuse hotline the number is achild  it is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you wantthe call is completely free and they are open  hours a day   days a week im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation you are a very brave and an intelligent child please remember to call  if you are in immediate danger
1949,my parents are threatening to get rid of the only things i still care about,the last of my emotions belong to my pets today my dad said he might get rid of them tomorrow if that does happen i might dig hole in the ground with a paper that says here lays my emotions rip i practically have no emotions left and i came to the realization about this not being normal by comparing my reaction to certain situations to my familys whats wrong with me,familyconflict,it sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about your pets i do not know what all is going on in your family and i cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind thisi would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills we cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us if you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing like your pets then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress it is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc develop other things that you care about and are passionate aboutanother reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you dont have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones you have to cope somehow right developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for youi dont know if this is what it is like for you at your house but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children one is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything the other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability people need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse
1950,keeping secrets from my family,i have secrets in my mind and i dont know what to do with them i dont want to tell my wife and mom because i dont want to hurt them but im not sure how long that i can keep the secret to myself what should i do its becoming annoying and making me anxious help me out,familyconflict,it sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now there are several things to consider before you make a decision you mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them  is it necessary for them to know this information what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves if your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel would you want to know the secrets how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthonce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not
1951,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,this brings back when i was doing internship with dr gray as a online coach  although i may not agree with a lot of the things he did he has updated his techniques a lot these days  fyi i kind of one of those interns back then who suggested because i know what i was dealing with during war time with military and my own marriage it wasnt his experience  cause it is the energy pattern the way your environment   it is  basic communications and you will still maybe have those men who love to hear themselves talk and if you even try to talk they tell you to  shut up which is abusive and that is another issue  but like being hearing impaired or speaking german  you need a translator or a tool to help or you need to try and learn sign language or speak german right  lol  its frustrating   men only listen with one side of the brain  work on that fellas  women both sides   you might think  is there something wrong with me it is not you its the delivery   i was around a lot of men with military  many of their things about their pet peeve in a trusting intimate type relationship like marriage is  women complain and nagg to much  and women say  but he doesnt do things  right  lol   i am right and i am better  but if you complain and nagg at a man too much he isnt going to listen   trust me  my cats are the same way  like calling them and they ignore me lol  its conditioning probaly he picked it up from his parents and so on  what he is doing is detaching that is how he deals with it   so you think he isnt listening to you  roles today are different men and women are conscious relationships not like the old days we are dealing with both male and female sides  empowered  you need to suppress your male side come back to your feminine not to go into him but him go into you  i have a book  get your love life running  coming back to your feminine side
1952,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,thanks for your question  communication is essential between couples and often times gets neglected in relationships  working with your husband to help him become a better listener and consequently a better communicator is going to take some work from your part  you have to calmly be able to express to him your concern and how it affects you  very important is that you do it in a loving and nonthreatening way  therefore the time to have this discussion is not when you are frustrated or need to vent to someone about something important  focus the discussion on how both of you could benefit from having more meaningful conversations where both parties are being heard and how it is important to you that he hears you just like it is crucial for him to be heard  there is a lot of useful information online about how to be a good listener or therapist in your area that can help you  be patient and genuine and he will come around  best of luck mirella
1953,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,does he know you do not feel heard      people typically feed off our energy  you feel you are not being heard and do all the listening and if you want to take massive action towards your being heard  communicate your needs he may not know how you feel and regardless your needs are key and seeking the support you need to move forward in a progressive way is essential  get the support you need and deserveare there others in your life that allow you to feel heard
1954,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,one of the keys to a successful and loving marriage is respectful communication have you talked to your husband about this in a calm and respectful way you would have to bring this to his attention in a way that doesnt put him on the defensive because it could very well be that he doesnt realize he is doing this an idea of how you could bring this up to him is by letting him know that you love him so much and you are sure that he probably doesnt do this intentionally but youve been feeling unheard when you tell him things see what he says after you let him know this couples therapy could also help you both very much with issues like this that come up
1955,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,thanks for reaching out this is a great question communication is definitely a way street one person cannot participate in a discussion it takes a talker and a listener furthermore communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying  since i cant ask you questions about what is going on i am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when i work with couples one person focuses more on solving the issue than listening to their partner  this can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be heardi understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you that can be really frustrating and difficult and i want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationshipone of the best strategies to gettting heard is actually to be a good listener to someone else i know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive right you want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening but this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills in other words you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teachpay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation no texting or distractions lean in focuslisten for content and for emotion clarify what you dont understand try to understand the persons underlying emotions dont rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on encourage the other person to continue speaking nod and vocalize that you hear what they are sayingask questions to get to understand the other persons point of viewi believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills and the other person feels heard they will be more likely to listen to us if you dont find that this doesnt spill over in that way then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it if there is push back from him set up a trial period to just try the skill perhaps for  weeks and see if it helps if communication is really breaking down then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skillsbest of luck to you
1956,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,its hard when you feel as if youre the only one thats taking the time to listen to your spouse but i would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you when you try and talk with your husband sometimes it can be in the way dialogue is approached i would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband see if blame and criticism are present when blame and criticism are included bids for connection can quickly go off track this can sometimes start off with something like why dont you you arent you dont partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack  also become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband sometimes this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another  if you find this pattern continues you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy a trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about whats happening between you
1957,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,does your husband want to listen to youfind this out by asking him the questionthis way you know whether the goal youd like to reach is even possiblesome partners prefer that one person is the rule maker or the only one who is entitled to talk about themselvesif your husband tells you he wants to listen to you or even that he does listen to you then you can explain in detail the way you define listening which may be very different than his definitionbasically no one can directly change someone into being more openmindedwhat is possible is to tell him your wishes your willingness to be patient while he develops the habit of listening to you and point out that a relationship is more fulfilling when both partners feel they are receiving from the other one
1958,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,unfortunately you cant directly change another persons behavior however you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you the best way to provide feedback is in  parts the first part is telling him the emotion you are experiencing when he doesnt listen such as hurt sad and unloved i would stay away from feelings such as frustrated angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion the second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way be specific example when i get home and tell you about my day and you dont look away from the tv be objective as possible when you describe his behavior and the last part is the most important tell him what you want him to do and again be specific example i would rather you turn off the tv give me eye contact and reassure me about my day here is an example with all  parts together i feel hurt when you dont say anything to me when i tell you about my fight with my friend i want you to hug me and tell me you understand how i feel hope that helps
1959,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,thanks for writing there are many different house of things that may be helpful here i can give you some general ideas but if some of these things dont get you to where you would like to go consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couplesremember that you can only guarantee change in yourself you can ask him to make changes but you cant control whether he does or not you can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts feelings and actions in the relationshipif youre going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen first ask whether this is a good timetry to talk to him without blaming fingerpointing or asking him to change this can be difficult but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussionsbe mindful of your packaging by that i mean that you may have a very important message that youre trying to get across if you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what youre actually saying that is helpful if you are talking in ways that are angry or as i sometimes say wrapped in spikes that can be difficult to hear and receive rather than hearing what youre actually trying to get across he may just hear the fact that you are angryif your husband is able to listen to you andor restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right let him know what that feels like to you and how important it isif youre asking questions try to avoid why question and use what makes how when where who instead questions starting with why can not only be difficult to answer but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right awayalso keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement this may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband  just because he is hearing what youre saying doesnt mean that hes agreeing with youlastly but importantly some people really dont know how to listen effectively there are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerabilityproducing it may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that hes really struggling
1960,how do i get my husband to listen to me,im always listening to my husband but it feels like he never listens to me    how do i get my husband to listen to me instead of me listening to him all the time,marriage,have the two of you ever discussed how you feel  i know given the nature of your question thats probably not likely but im going to suggest it any way  he needs to understand that how you feel about this issue equates to not being as happy in the relationship as you could be or he thinks you are  so start there that may be more of an attention getter than you never listen to me yes i do etc  direct opener  im not as happy in this relationship as i think we both deserve  pause and if you wont let me talk about it then its only going to get worse  then explain you dont feel listened to you try to be a good listener but you dont feel you are getting the same in return  if he interrupts put your hand up in the sign of a stop then say please just let me finish  you are right to raise this subject with him because a good marriage cant exist in a communication vacuum in fairness to him he needs to understand the seriousness of your concern and have a chance to do better  if he refuses  tell him you want to seek couples counseling then do it with him or without him
1961,why does my husband like dressing as a female in our bedroom,he wants to wear makeup and heels he even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina he wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him i have tried this for him but i dont like it and have told him so he keeps making comments about it and says he cant live without it,marriage,depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be normal in the bedroom i can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you  it doesnt necessarily mean however that your husband is gay bisexual transgender or even necessarily a crossdresser etc unless he has already told you so i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you that being said what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isnt always what we identify as  lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture for example many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly dont consider themselves kinky submissive or anything else  it could be that your husband enjoys pretending fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband father son friend etc  many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because its the opposite of what their life typically entails eg a high profile ceo who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at the mercy of someone else once a week each of us has a sexual script  a blueprint if you will of what we like and dont like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal  its also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression sexual orientation sexual behaviors sexual desires and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives gagnon  simon youve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment all of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations its like our own sex fingerprint in my role as a couples counselor i often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ  if a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied the relationship thrives most counselors would agree that a healthy script includesboth partners taking ownership for the couples sexual experiencesboth partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelingsboth partners learning to meet one anothers  needs desires and wishes while making sure hisher own needs are being metif pegging your husband as its called is a hard and fast no for you that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script  however if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about needing to dress in a female fashion andor be anally penetrated you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesnt hurt either one of you or the marriagemy warmest wishes to you both
1962,why does my husband like dressing as a female in our bedroom,he wants to wear makeup and heels he even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina he wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him i have tried this for him but i dont like it and have told him so he keeps making comments about it and says he cant live without it,marriage,it sounds like you may be asking two different questionswith regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom i wonder if you would consider asking him more about this if you choose to do that i would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience this can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion it may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly if what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing i also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over timeyou could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are havingas far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you dont like andor understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here it depends on what you both preferthese types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially having structured conversations such as the ones ive described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argumentalso consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas
1963,i dont feel a connection to my husband anymore,im feeling different towards my husband i feel i am growing from the relationship i have been with my husband for six years and married for almost five i just dont feel that connection anymore i feel nothing i dont know why or if im just being irrational,marriage,lacey im so glad you wrote thousands of people are having this same feeling right now im glad youre paying attention to it when you first meet someone there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection then what happens is because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we dont have to work hard to earn their love anymore that sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years long enough to procreate and keep the human race going and then it wears off a bit and you end up looking at each other thinking how come i dont feel the same anymoremostly not always and ill get to that in a minute all that this means is youve stopped doing all those loving things you used to do its as though you filled the car with gas youve run out of gas now and youre forgetting to put more inthe first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that youve cut back on act lovingly and you will likely regain those feelings talk to your partner about this its okay to say do you remember we used to do xy and z can we do that again can i get more of the foot rubs you used to give me ask for what you want instead of complaining what are your love languages what are your partners marriages need to be fed its that simple many things get in the waychildren jobs but mostly complacency get active with your loveokay now you might read this and think thats not whats happening thats a cue to talk to someone like a therapist about your feelings people do grow and change and sometimes relationships dont fit anymore but these are huge decisions not to be made lightly i wish you happiness
1964,im disgusted by my own fetish,i have an overwhelming desire to watch my wife have sex with another man i talked to her about it and she said she will do it for me the idea excites me to no end but i dont want to because it disgusts me how can i stop wanting it or should i just give into it and do it ive been struggling for years with this it wont go away by the way i am in my mid s and my wife is in her mid s,marriage,try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilledsince you and your wife are in a relationship the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wifei suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangementby anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control or in control since its your wish being fulfilled all the feelings you and her are able to expect youll be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the eventthere are a lot of unknowns in the situation youre considering  having your partner who will be key in satisfying your sex wish be active in understanding these unknowns is a good way of keeping your relationship strong overall
1965,my husband doesnt trust me,my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had i know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over that i am messing around which i am not,marriage,im sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship trust as you clearly know is essential to healthy relationships past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances we tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties on your end you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy gestures of transparency eg  giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities and more patience and empathy for his fears on his end he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you attempting to control you or limiting your freedom if you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life i would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist
1966,my husband doesnt trust me,my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had i know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over that i am messing around which i am not,marriage,the good news in the way youre feeling is recognizing that your husbands trust of your actions makes a difference to youthe typical therapy formula for restoring trust between two people after some sort of betrayal is for the one who has broken the trust to earn it backrestoring trust requires both persons to actively involve themselves in this processthe person who tires earning back trust must know what standards for this of the one who was betrayedthe person who feels betrayed must willingly be open minded to accepting the efforts of the one who tries earning back their trustas simple as this formula sounds the actual process of restoring trust raises a lot of emotion on both sides therefore causing difficulty in keeping discussions in this area on trackthe best way of success in restoring trust between partners is utilizing a couples therapist who would be able to guide your conversations back on track and also open emotions for discussion when relevant to restoring trustgood luck in establishing new terms with your partner
1967,my husband doesnt trust me,my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had i know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over that i am messing around which i am not,marriage,it is incredibly frustrating to not be trusted when you know you are doing nothing wrong if the lack of trust on your husbands end has to do with something you did in the past then be patient and give it time once trust is broken it takes time and effort to gain it back try seeing the situation from your husbands perspective as often times looking at situations from different angles gives us new understanding and insight remember that you cant change how he feels but you can help him to regain the trust by asking him what he needs and responding to his needs as best you can seeing a couples counselor is never a bad idea and it would also be beneficial for you and oryour husband to seek out individual therapy there may be other unknown factors that you are unaware of that are contributing to the trust issues and inability to resolve them hope everything works out for you
1968,my husband doesnt trust me,my husband doesnt trust me for some past we had i know all marriages have their ups and downs but sometimes i feel i am getting tired of the same thing over and over that i am messing around which i am not,marriage,hi louisianaits normal when trust has been broken in the past for fear and insecurities to come up from time to time his reactions may not mean that he doesnt trust you but rather that he gets scared that hes going to be hurt again youre a bit vague about the past you dont say whether you cheated or not if you did then you might try taking an approach where you a take responsibility for your past actions b show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that c do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority and d reassure him when he says hes scared or feeling insecure im suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that youre so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear this is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injurypart of the issue might be that when he brings it up hes coming across as angry accusing or suspicious rather than scared and insecure this often happens a therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger which is also natural but less helpful in those moments and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him as much as you want to forget about it he might need to talk about it sometimes and thats normal his needs are important also important however is your need for respect if he approaches it in a disrespectful way thats a separate problem if its brought up as a weapon used to shut you down or used to control or punish those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts you can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the pasta qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory best of luck
1969,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,this is a fantastic question in one sentence i would say the followingrecognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality you are separate people each with different wants wishes and desires  if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality could be more or less and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping indicating separate interestsas for ways that may strengthen any relationship even the great ones this is what came to mind there are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details but here are some general ideastry to have at least  minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problemsolvingrealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromlearn to hold on to your own wants wishes and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerset boundaries for what is and isnt acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussiondiscuss how having important discussions can be anxietyproducing and consider having an understanding that if one of you or both of you feels overwhelmed you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time for example you may say okay im feeling really stressed about this right now lets discuss it in an hour and at that time go back to the discussionconsider what your partners top three or four complaints about you may be check in with them and see how accurate you are if you see validity in their responses consider whether or not you may want to make changesdiscover what makes your partner feel loved valued appreciated or specialrelationships are always in progress and constantly changing some anxiety around change is typical being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive name calling fingerpointing or asking each other to change is a true giftyou may enjoy this quote connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen heard and valued when they can give and receive without judgment brene brown
1970,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,i appreciate your questionthe answer of what makes a good marriage are as varied as there are marriagesbasically similarity like mindedness in beliefs and values makes a good marriage the best chance of getting along with someone on a longterm basis is when two people see life and the world in similar wayseven though opposites attract this is a short lived dynamic which breaks apart when there arent enough similarities in common between the partners
1971,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,in addition to suggesting this great read from  but feels timelesshttpswwwnytimescomopinionsundaywhyyouwillmarrythewrongpersonhtml_ri will give my summary on what the author of the article is speaking to dont get too comfortable but in truth no one really has the answer to your question otherwise wouldnt we all have a good marriage also what even is a good marriage what is it that you want from a marriage a relationship a partner and what your otherhalf also wants for themselves is going to be what defines all of this because every relationship is differentand in answering that what you want question you might actually stumble upon what would make for a healthy relationship vulnerability you will have to be vulnerable to be able to explore what you really want and listen to what your partner really wants as that kind of processing can be uncomfortable but with vulnerability comes intimacy and in most opinions there is much of a relationship if there isnt much intimacy
1972,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,what a great question marriage or any longterm committed romantic relationship is never easy ups  downs doubts and fights are a part of it just the same as the wonderful tender blissful moments of connection recognizing that hardships are normal and something to work through is a big part of the healthy attitude partners in lasting relationships share some degree of conflict is not something to be scared of or a sign its time to break up as long as all parties involved feel respected expressing your needs and wants in a respectful not accusing manner will increase the chances that your loved one will actually listen empathize with your perspective and will be more open to finding solutions to your problems together working as a team to find solutions to problems you encounter is a much better approach than trying to persuade your partner that you are right while they are most certainly wrong shutting your partner out or allowing resentment and contempt to creep into your relationships is definitely a warning sign that things may not be going the way you want anymore as long as you both agree that you want to be in that relationship ie are committed to it and you have a growth mindset we will learn from this and grow together to be a better couple in the end the foundation of your partnership is strong what else making time for each other whether its being playful having fun or enjoying intimate moments together is also an important part of ensuring a good balance of positive to negative experiences that will only strenghten your bond good luck
1973,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,a resource i think is helpful to learn more about what makes a good marriage and steps toward doing so is dr john gottmans book seven principles for making marriage work dr gottman is a leader in this field and has done extensive studies with couples to determine what behaviors are key in making a marriage work and what behaviors could predict divorce i think this book might be a good start if youre wanting to learn more about how to have a long lasting relationship
1974,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,when i ask my couples why are you together they often will say because we love each other well thats great but its not enough love is what brings us together in the first place its that magical hormonal glue that creates a powerful biological bond that ensures we get together mate and have kids when that magic fades the difficult work of making good marriage starts it takes more than love you have to have a shared purpose a shared reason for being together for many couples its about having kids or selfactualization or buying a house it can be anything but a good marriage is one in which both partners can answer the question in the same way and have thought and talked about before another sign of a good lasting marriage is one in which each partner takes an active role in helping the other through hard times when they disagree they spend more energy trying to understand the other person instead of proving their own point they can quickly drop the sword listen and reflect accurately and demonstrate care and genuine concern finally a good marriage is one where there is affection notice i didnt say sex ive worked with couples who havent had sex in years and they were the happiest couple in my practice sex doesnt equal intimacy or affection im talking about cuddling holding hugging im talking about that deep relaxation feeling you get when you just let go into the arms of your partner that kind of affection its crucial you deserve this kind of relationship and you have everything in you to make it happen sometimes we just need some support and guidance dont hesitate to reach out for help it can make all the difference good luck
1975,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,its surprising how many folks talk too much on the subjectits the same three things that make all relationships workhonestytrustrespectin that ordermost folks fall down on the first  coughcough therapists  heh heh heh
1976,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,thank you for your question  a good marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment  being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because lets face it we are dealing with  unique individuals with differences  a good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting  knowing each others strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another  a good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy  dont get me wrong that also means that it is important to have alone time to recharge and refocus our purpose in the marriage  in all there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage but with time work and purpose one can have a happy one
1977,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,in my mind a healthy marriage has two participants meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage an unequal participation comes in many forms such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional or speaking over and for each other in these conversations couples should strive for engagement and support but doing it in a way that works for each person individually i hope this helps
1978,what makes a good marriage,what makes a healthy marriage last,marriage,this answer varies based on you relationship however i do believe their are some basic fundamental areas that are beneficial for a healthy marriage effective communication trust lovepassion loyalty  unconditional positive regard everyone has their favorite qualities they feel best fit a marriage however these are what i think are great starting points
1979,my husband yells enough when i tell him he needs to change,that phrase makes me crazy it happens anytime i point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his ipad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that i got all the things he needs to bake a pie another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up over and over again he lets the dog run out and i am afraid he will get hit by a car,marriage,i empathize with your feeling crazy hearing your husband yell enough in response to you wanting to make a point to himwhen the immediate situation has calmed down  have you ever told him that this upsets you  is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to youkeep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to changea helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happenedby learning more about how the other person thinks and feels it will be easier to know what to expect form each othereven if you disagree about what is best knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept or at least not be surprised and startled by themsending good luck to both of you
1980,my husband yells enough when i tell him he needs to change,that phrase makes me crazy it happens anytime i point out something to my husband that he needs to change such as looking up from his ipad long enough for me to tell him the grandbaby almost pulled the shelf unit over or explaining to him that i got all the things he needs to bake a pie another example is when he opens the front door the dog runs out if he doesnt pick him up over and over again he lets the dog run out and i am afraid he will get hit by a car,marriage,its hard to say what is okay and what is not okay as it depends on what you and your husband feel is appropriate in your relationship if you are feeling like you need to walk on eggshells or that you cant speak your mind and say how you feel then that sounds like a problem i would recommend having an open discussion with your husband about communication between the two of you in general do this during a time when there is little or no conflict and emotions are not heightened let him know how you feel and give him specific ideas of how you would like him to respond instead of saying enough additionally try and see his perspective and understand why he shuts you down perhaps he feels like he is being told what to do constantly or that he gets little positive feedback from you an open dialogue about how to discuss issues going forward will likely help seeing a couples therapist will also greatly assist with teaching better communication skills and seeing if there are underlying issues that need resolution best of luck to you guys

1982,is my marriage worth saving,all we do is argue we never agree on anything,marriage,simply yesjust because you argue does not mean your marriage is not worth it couples disagree they are different people from different worlds with different likes and dislikes trying to mesh these different worlds is tough but does not mean you dont need to not be marriedthere are reasons why couples dont get along finding out why you cannot compromise and working towards similar goals can help talking about what you really want out of the marriage and relationship may show yall how much your relationship goals are similar then you can build upon thatlearning communication skills listening skills and ways to improve your ability to express self without anger can help
1983,is my marriage worth saving,all we do is argue we never agree on anything,marriage,for how long has the arguing been occurring and does it relate to a specific incident or circumstance in your relationshiparguing due to temporary stress and feeling lost or uncertain is different than the two of you rarely agree on what foods to buy at the grocery storein both temporary or longer term arguing ask yourself if the points being argued are core principles of yours or matters which you can accept in service to the benefits you feel from the marriageif your core principles are rejected youve been arguing for an extended amount of time and the value of the marriage doesnt outweigh this then seriously consider if ending the relationship is a better option than to stay in it
1984,my wife is cheating and wont tell me the truth,i found out today that my wife is cheating on me i love her but she wont tell the truth even when i have proof when i beg her to tell the truth she yells cusses and gets a huge attitude,marriage,hi prattville im sorry this is happening to you you need support right now and yes you need answers she is in denial and is trying to hide the truth to protect herself this is a natural behaviour you dont indicate whether she wants the marriage or is planning to leave which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question if she wants the marriage you certainly have the right to say i need answers to all my questions giving you the information she needs has to be if she wants the marriage more important than protecting herself i would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions she may fear that the truth will turn you away if you want to you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is if the marriage is to survive it needs opennessif on the other hand shes planning to end the marriage then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek you are better off in that case seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door your wife has some decisions to make try to give her a bit of time to make them you can patiently say i know this thing is happening talk to me so we can deal with it together i want to move forward but i need the truth only time and a good therapist if she is willing and wants the marriage will tell which way this one will go individually you can seek professional help as well
1985,how can my marriage be fixed,ive only been married three months every week we argue about something and it seems to be getting worse,marriage,one key factor to consider is are you able to repair after your arguments it seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument when couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forward im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over if youre stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about  minutes the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  when things are good between you  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this cycle and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time that way when this is enacted during an argument nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time rather both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs
1986,how can my marriage be fixed,ive only been married three months every week we argue about something and it seems to be getting worse,marriage,at the begin g of marriages we expect to be living on an eternal honeymoon but the reality can be different  this is a process of adaptation even if you had known your better half for a long time during the first months and years of marriage you go through a process of settling in your new roles and confront new challenges together that as you resolve become new rules and agreementsyes you can work this issues by practicing assertive communication being clear with each other about what is the problem how you feel about it and how would you like to resolve it  learn to close arguments with resolutions and reminding that you care about each other thats why you choose to be together  discuss your roles and expectations this is normally done over a marriage preparation class is never too late to sit down a talk about what you want and look for in a husbandwife and clarify your roles and rules find couples therapist who mediates communication and helps both of to you learn assertive communication skills and conflict resolution cómo puedo arreglar mi matrimoniohe estado casado por tan solo tres meses  cada semana discutimos sobre algo y parece ponerse cada vez peoral inicio del matrimonio esperamos vivir una eterna luna de miel pero la realidad es diferente  es un proceso de adaptación sin importar por cuánto tiempo hayas conocido a tu pareja   durante estos primeros meses se definen los roles en el matrimonio también enfrentan nuevos retos juntos que según resuelven se convierten en reglas y acuerdossí puedes resolver estos problemas practicando comunicación asertiva deben aclarar sobre cuál es el problema como se sienten al respecto y como lo quieren resolver  aprendan a resolver las discusiones con decisiones claras y recordando que si les importan uno al otro y por eso decidieron estar juntos en primer lugar  discutan sus roles y expectativas regularmente esto se hace durante clases de preparación matrimonial pero nunca es tarde para hablar sobre lo que les gustaría que fuera su matrimonio y lo que esperan de su pareja así clarifican los roles y reglas que aplicaran a su uniónencuentren un consejero matrimonial que les ayude a mediar los problemas de comunicación y les ayude a aprender destrezas de comunicación asertiva y resolución de conflictos
1987,what makes my husband so selfish when it comes to my feelings,if i tell him i dont like certain things he does when it pertains to me he tells me its not like that he never has anything to say about me until i tell him something about himself,marriage,it sounds like there are issues with communication between you and your husband  your perceptions of interactions that you are having dont sound like they match up  it would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using i statements i feelwhen you  this is a more effective way of communicating your needs than directly criticizing the other person  if you work on communicating in new less critical ways you both may learn more about your spouses feelings and perspective
1988,about a year ago i found out my husband had cheated on me,cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters i decided not to break up the family however now i am struggling to forget and forgive what happened i feel like i cannot trust him without trust i cannot stay in this relationship on the other hand i do not want my children to get hurt im not sure how to move forward,marriage,first of all my heart goes out to you infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome there are some things that you should consider first of all did he seem truly remorseful if you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake secondly was he forthcoming with this information how about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered if you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful he should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitationthirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience at this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the childrenkeep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief it is not a quick process that can easily be overcome what you are experiencing is  normal my best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved i know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either if you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needsplease know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing it may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles the web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding boardbest of luck to you and your family
1989,about a year ago i found out my husband had cheated on me,cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters i decided not to break up the family however now i am struggling to forget and forgive what happened i feel like i cannot trust him without trust i cannot stay in this relationship on the other hand i do not want my children to get hurt im not sure how to move forward,marriage,to begin im sorry to hear about your situation like many of the professionals have stated infidelity is a very difficult obstacle to move forward from its not impossible while forgetting is probably the hardest part forgiveness is something that can and will happen there are things you can do to help yourself the first this is identifying what you feel is best for yourself and your children that means being honest with how you feel being in this relationship on a daily basis and understanding how its affecting you second how is your relationship affecting the children do you feel that by staying in the relationship that its affecting your daily interaction with them if so that something to keep in mind next really looking at the pros and cons of staying in the relationship a specific breakdown of what benefits come with staying and what are the ramifications viceversa for leaving include your partner i think being honest with him and letting him know what you are thinking is could be a great option at least you arent keeping something inside yourself to manage rather you are being transparent to them sometimes a couple can come to an agreement that it may be time to end things and other times it may be best to keep moving forward with a serious plan to how to move forward regardless if you cant trust him and that feeling will never go away its time to address it couple therapy can be beneficial as well as a therapist can provide professional counseling to you earl lewiswwwrelationshipsgonerightcom
1990,about a year ago i found out my husband had cheated on me,cheating is something unacceptable for me but because we have two daughters i decided not to break up the family however now i am struggling to forget and forgive what happened i feel like i cannot trust him without trust i cannot stay in this relationship on the other hand i do not want my children to get hurt im not sure how to move forward,marriage,it is completely understandable that you are struggling to forgive and forget this betrayal and id like to echo the sentiment of danielle alvarez infidelity takes time to heal from so allow yourself to grieve and find the support you need id highly suggest going to couples therapy and addressing all the issues that danielle raised especially whether he has expressed genuine remorse and is being completely transparent with you and is taking responsibility for the choice he made including acknowledging the immense impact it had on you your relationship and your ability to trust him if you have doubts about being able to trust him he needs to be willing to earn back your trust and do whatever it takes to do so if he accepts this challenge then that is a good sign you are on the path toward healing your relationship also please dont ever forget that regardless of what led him to cheat it was his decision to take that action rather than addressing whatever issues he was having in your relationship couples affected by betrayal typically have some underlying issues whether it is a lack of connection or intimacy or another factor and it is possible to heal and grow even stronger as a couple after betrayal because you are grieving though allow yourself to acknowledge and accept your feelings of hurt and pain as they will likely come in waves but the pain will lessen over time and with supportive therapy along with the commitment to repair your relationshipfrom both you and your husband also in regards to your concern about hurting your children keep in mind that parents model healthy relationship behavior for their children if your relationship with your husband remains disconnected untrusting or bitter your children will see that and not only feel sad that their parents are both suffering but also grow up feeling that experiencing such ongoing pain is tolerable or even normal in a relationship having parents who learn to handle conflict or heal deep wounds in healthy ways is crucial for childrens emotional and psychological development whether they see you heal together as a married couple or heal separately as loving but divorced coparents they will learn what it is like to expect healthy communication and boundaries in relationships which im sure you want for your children take care of yourself and i wish you much peace and healing also here is a good book i would recommend along with books by gottman as rebecca wong suggestedprivate lies infidelity and the betrayal of intimacy

1992,why am i with my husband if he is mean,i love him but he doesnt show me love he talks badly about me to his friends,marriage,what you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other a direct lack of respect the challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try the only person that you have control of is yourself so then the question that this reality poses is what are you willing to change if you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that the change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself the way you treat yourself and what you accept your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well it would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts you have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life sometimes the differencechange can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation and sometimes they get left behind  you must do some deep introspection through therapy to get to the point where you can answer this question for yourself
1993,why am i with my husband if he is mean,i love him but he doesnt show me love he talks badly about me to his friends,marriage,"hello and thank you for your question loving someone who
doesnt respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful 
many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtful
relationship say that it was wonderful when it first started but that over
time their partners behaviors changed and they became emotionally or
physically abusive 
i want to say right away that it is not your fault in any
way if someone is abusive to you it does not mean that you are broken or that there
is something wrong with your character if you have not left the situation
people stay for many reasons such as fear finances children pressure from
others and love 
many people have had to leave their abusive partners who
they still love to preserve their own safety and regain the sense of self they
may have lost it is a very difficult thing to do even if you know it is the
right thing 
the person who really needs to take a hard look at
themselves is the person doing the abusing
it is very common for mental and emotional abuse to wear
away at someones selfesteem this can lead to other problems like depression
and anxiety these issues sometimes require professional support to manage
such as a counselor or perhaps a doctor who may prescribe medication 
a counselor may be able to help you sort through your fears
and concerns about staying or leaving to look at things from different angles
and to help you decide what is best for you 
you have not said that your husband has been physically abusive
to you but if that has been the case then you must consider your physical
safety first leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time
getting help from professionals would be critical and i would recommend your
local domestic violence program 
whatever you decide to do is the right thing for you i
would encourage you to ask yourself honestly about your reasons for staying and
the barriers that may keep you from going you do deserve to be happy and
emotionally safe if you do not feel like you have that safety then seeking
someone to help you sort through these things is a good plan 
i wish you well

1994,why am i with my husband if he is mean,i love him but he doesnt show me love he talks badly about me to his friends,marriage,so many questions comes to mind when i read your wordsdo you love yourself  what do you love about him  what are you getting from this relationship that is good for you  what are you lacking in yourself that you allow yourself to be treated this wayi can go onif you can answer these questions maybe you will answer your own question of why are you with your husband or even better why you allow your husband to be mean show no love disrespect you  you seem to lack selfworthseek a professional to help you with this
1995,how do i deal with my husband being mean to me,my father is in the hospital and was diagnosed with leukemia i have been dealing with that all day my husband keeps getting mad at me for things that i said,marriage,i dont know how long you have been married but this might be a time to explain to your husband what you wish he could do for you in this moment it could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong maybe he would be open to an honest discussion
1996,my husband seems to be changing and i feel angry and hurt,my husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person before he worked and slept and on off days hed stay home because he didnt want to do anything else now hes going out with friends several nights a week while im still home working a  hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself hes suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife but the whole time im remembering how ive been emotionally starving for the last five years,marriage,it seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally  could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression obviously something has shifted which you do not understand therefore  perhaps you should consider attending couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings  it would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection or shut down connection imago dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches  validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection
1997,my husband seems to be changing and i feel angry and hurt,my husband took a job out of state for the next year and seems to be a different person before he worked and slept and on off days hed stay home because he didnt want to do anything else now hes going out with friends several nights a week while im still home working a  hours a week job and taking care of two kids by myself hes suddenly saying he misses me and wants me to be his adored wife but the whole time im remembering how ive been emotionally starving for the last five years,marriage,my first concern is you as you stated you have been emotionally starving for the past five years  please try to find time for you to clarify your thoughts and feelings by writing talking to a trusted friend or family member and perhaps seeing a therapistwhats really going on with your husband  does he discuss in detail his sudden change can the two of you still talk do you want the same things  before you go to couples counseling i suggest that you get some support first to feel grounded within yourself and your life  make sure you are ready to hear what might come out of counseling   i wish you the best
1998,am i wrong because i dont want to sit on the same couch my wife had sex with another man on while we were still married,i decided to stay and work it out i just dont want to sit on the couch other than that i have been getting over the situation i dont feel it is fair that she expects me to sit on that couch and wont leave me alone about it i can move on and continue to love laugh and play with my wife i just dont want to sit on that couch,marriage,houston its normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger so i get why you dont want to sit on it but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive am i to assume that you cant afford a new one ideally she buys you a new couch but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forward t will be interesting to see if theres anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gone
1999,can my marriage be saved,my husband and i have been together since high school we have been married going on for nearly ten years and we have three beautiful children a few weeks ago my husband decided he need some time apart and moved over to his dads for a while he comes home to see the kids and acts like there is not too much wrong can this marriage be saved or is it too late he said he would go to counseling so i dont think he has given up,marriage,while it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support with appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible im not familiar with the resources available in jackson but im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy so often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress loneliness anger and resentment i commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children the following links provides more information regarding common behaviours that predict staying together or separating and also videos and other resources that can help you get started wishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discovery
2000,my husband seems to end his relationships with women whenever he has an infant,my husband and i wouldve been married for five years come june  our infant daughter just had her birthday shortly before he told me he wanted a divorce he has four other children three of which are from his first wife he decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant the children do not have a good relationship with him now he has another child from a woman he was dating he decided he didnt want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant    it seems to me that there is a pattern he easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the childs life but wants a relationship with them when they are older ive tried to research online but im not getting any answers he also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder he also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have where do you recommend researching this,marriage,this sounds really difficult and i can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband continues to have a relationship with you and your children with that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for in order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do  while it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices
2001,how do i move on from my husbands cheating,my husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad it was a time when my health was poor im have a hard time moving on,marriage,how has your husband acted since then was he regretful how did you find out did he confess these are all things that you want to consider betrayal is very hard to get over so if its taking you awhile to get over know that this is normalhopefully youre husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened it may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this its also very important to discuss why he cheated you want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future and if it can there needs to be an action plan in place ie being honest with how hes feeling so that you both get a chance to rectify the situationif the cheating has happened more than once you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage it would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldnt repeat the same mistake however if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake i would give it a try people do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you haveknow that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel if the relationship was a good healthy relationship it is worth saving ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings in return your husband should be patient and understanding of this also marriage counselors are often a good goto as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations best of luck to you
2002,how can i let go of my dream wedding,i have been with my husband for almost  years we got engaged a little after  years of being together i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose  when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned i was happy but i couldnt help feeling disappointed too i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldnt help how i was feeling we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasnt due to lack of funds i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding what i wanted will never happen i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just cant control it its ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it plus i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed  why cant i move on,marriage,its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either however like you know the marriage is the most important thing how many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship i assure you that there are plenty try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired focus on what you can control now perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringi would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately but after that close that chapter and move on it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change
2003,can a therapist have a client admitted to an eating disorder treatment center if the client does not want to go,,eatingdisorders,typically a therapist cannot force a client to receive any treatment they do not want  in the end it is the clients who get to decide what type of treatment they wantif a therapist believes that their client is in imminent danger of harm however the therapist might have an obligation to take actions to protect their client  in such a case the therapist would need to discuss the options with the client and come up with a plan to best protect the clientin a situiaon like this it would probably be a good idea to talk to the therapist about the possilbe positvies and negatives of the treatmetn center  a good therpist will be happy to have that conversation with you and allow you to make the final decisions about your own treatment

2016,i hardly eat but i gain weight instead of lose weight why,,eatingdisorders,first step always is to have a medical evaluation so you are aware of any physiological conditions which may explain an answer to your questionif medically there is no condition to explain why you gain weight instead of losing weight even though you hardly eat then start noticing the types of food you eatalmost all packaged foods sold in supermarkets and cooked by fast food places and shopping mall restaurants  are processed to have a long shelf life and are artificially colored and have flavors added to themwith the natural taste and texture gone it is very easy to eat a lot more calories than your body needs before feeling fullthe extra calories become extra weight eventuallyalso it is possible that even with the most natural food choices if there is a psychological reason for eating such as stress or anxiety then someone may not notice they are eating more food than their body needssending good wishes on playing around with these ideas and finding an answer with which youre happy
2017,how can i train myself to stop eating when im full,i have no self control over food most people stop when theyve had enough but i keep eating for the pleasure of it especially with sweets  im never done eating dessert,eatingdisorders,hello im so glad you decided to write in today this is such a great question and im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing there are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern first i think its important to understand food is just food food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations but in many cultures we place a lot of emphasis on food we have food at every gathering and every celebration whats more people have come to almost expect food to be present at any and every gettogether and if its not well then forget about it i see this time and time again with my clients donuts appear in the office and its almost like donuts have never been there before must eat one or two however we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food it is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day during these moments i like to have my clients employ a stopandthink method stopandthink about your goals before you eat is this donut getting you where you want to be also i have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut if the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut but if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating are you trying to drown out other emotions are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment what else is going on this can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a thought record a thought record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers by targeting the emotions we can then determine where theyre coming from as well as how to decipher them a therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the thought recordthe most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people if food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands there are lots of free resources and information on my website at wwwmaddenwellnesskycom in addition i offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and i would love to help amber

2019,how can i ask my boyfriend about who hes texting,weve been in a long distance relationship for two and a half years i recently saw his phone and saw the people he texts the most and one of them was a female coworker i dont know how to approach this situation how do i ask him about it,relationships,i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others these questions help couples to build connection and trust its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance if he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that if he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actionsdr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca

2025,why wont my boyfriend for almost two years talk about our future together when he says hes in love with me,,relationships,hi atlantic cityyou must feel confused this happens quite a bita couple will be very much in love but with time it becomes more and more clear that there is a barrier to moving forward to deeper intimacy and commitment you dont provide details but i will give you what my best hunch is about what might be happening herea few possibilitiesits possible that hes not as in love as he says some people find it hard to be honest about these things theres no way to tell for sure but look for signs that hes not all that into this relationship even though he says he is its also possible hes just not ready to commit long term and if thats the case he could say so and help you understand this i think its more likely though that hes very in love with you but has an emotional barrier to moving forwardfor you its simpleyou love him and want to plan a future for him its not so simple though i believe your boyfriend probably loves you very much but there is something else preventing him from being able to plan a future with you hes likely scared about something scared hes not good enough or that hell be hurt and that fear makes him avoid commitment and deep intimacy his fears have nothing to do with you they are based on his own emotional history its a barrier that doesnt become evident until intimacy is already established getting close to someone triggers our deep fears he can get close but only so close its really important you know this isnt your fault theres no other person out there who will have a magic key to make him want a future with them its not about you at allthere are a few ways that this can go if he recognises this barrier and wants to change it he can try therapy to address his emotional barriers thats up to him and only him if you send him to therapy he might resent that couple therapy may help but a couple therapist may also recommend he do some individual exploring firstfor you it will be helpful to simply be aware of your own needs in a relationship if as a couple you keep hitting this wall of his over and over again thats going to be painful you may eventually decide that you need a partner with a stronger ability to commit long term theres nothing essentially wrong with the way he is its just not a good match for you because you have a different pace in a relationship let him know what you need some security for the future of your relationship if you want to or plan to have children this is a natural thing to wantand then see if he can give it to youso do some thinking first then go to him not in anger hes just being himself after all and anger wont help but with your dilemma i love you and i want a partner to plan a future with can you do that with me then you see what happens 
2026,why wont my boyfriend for almost two years talk about our future together when he says hes in love with me,,relationships,there are a few possibilities that might be keeping your boyfriend from talking about the future but the best way to find out for certain is to ask him  if your desire is to have a permanent relationship with your boyfriend two years should be plenty of time for him to determine whether or not he also wants this and if not yet he should be able to give you a reason why people who drag their feet in the area of commitment sometimes do so because they fear commitment itself and the thought of permanency is terrifying to them  such fears might be grounded in past failed relationships past history of abuse or neglect  or just pure selfishness and a related fear of what they might have to give up in a relationship another common reason for people to avoid talking about permanency is because there are things in the relationship that they feel may need to change before the relationship becomes more committed  financial and career issues are common reasons for postponing commitment  other issues may have to do with taking care of other family responsibilities such as raising children from previous relationships the most important thing to remember i think in managing your own feelings in this relationship is that you have the right to ask questions and to have a conversation about your future  you are part of this relationship and you deserve to know what types of barriers are there that prevent this relationship from becoming permanent  true love needs to be grounded in truth good luck to you
2027,why wont my boyfriend for almost two years talk about our future together when he says hes in love with me,,relationships,the good news is youre aware of what youd like from your relationshipthe possible less good news is that your boyfriends ideas for the relationship are not similar to yoursreally you will only find this out for sure by deciding to start the conversation about your expectations and ask about hispeople have as infinitely different ideas of what if anything generates from feeling in love as there are people on this earthspeculating and theorizing about how he combines love and a future with you at some point are better answered directly by himyou sound ready to find out his reality in order to compare it with yourssometimes people are afraid that the answer theyll hear will disappoint  while this is possible it is also possible you will be greatly surprised in a very happy way  what if he was being shy and hesitant to tell you his wish of being together with you for many yearseither way the answer turns out you will gain as a person by appreciating your own need for peace of mind by knowing clearly what your future with this man will be like

lets just start with being real expressing
yourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard it takes courage and work
to be vulnerable my guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable ie expressing yourself is unsafe my assumption would be
you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again this is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt it
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayi would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally after you feel you have a good grasp
on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others choose others that
feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family
member expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors
just the same best of luck"
2058,how can i keep a long distance relationship going,we werent long distance until he joined the military i love him and i know he loves me but its complicated he said hes not going to find someone else but im afraid how do i keep our relationship going,relationships,hello you are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship i wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him  or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future the more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure however if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship to help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment for many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and skype its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life other times it is making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for longdistance ones dr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca

   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,the most important thing to ask yourself here is how did this action affect my relationship and is it worth the consequences regardless of your intentions in this action your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior from here we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as is worth harming the relationship you currently have it is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes many times it just gives the wrong impressions it is very possible that your partner may believe that since you spend so much time with them that they are still a contender for the most intimate relationship you have to offer and truth be told they kind of are the best intimate relationships are friendships first and foremost it is also a good thing to consider what you are getting out of the relationship with your ex that you are not getting out of the relationship with your current boyfriend if you go to this person for emotional support before your boyfriend then it is very likely youre involved in some emotional infidelity when we turn to others instead of our partner it is as if we ran into another persons arms instead of theirs no matter who you are that hurts

   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,your boyfriend is probably feeling jealous and maybe threatened by your friend does he know you had a relationship with your friend in the past it is not uncommon for him to feel this way as he was not included in your weekend with both of you is it possible for the three of you to spend some time together if you want to continue your friendship with this friend without it impacting your current relationship with your boyfriend maybe you can start there and see if everyone can be comfortable with this arrangement

   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,depends on your definition of wrong on this one was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend who also happens to be an ex probably not but it upset your current boyfriend and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him he may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do thatlong story short it might help your relationship to understand more and be curious not judgey around what is upsetting for him perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your exes

   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,while you cant be responsible for your boyfriends feelings relationships do come with expectations  both people in a relationship bring their own expectations into it  these expectations are usually unspoken but result in conflict as you are experiencing here  your boyfriend expects you not to spend the weekend with this guy  he may expect you not to spend the weekend with any guy at all  he may expect you to spend every single weekend with him  youll have to decide if his expectations are ones you can live with  relationships do require some compromise out of concern for our partner but you get to choose how much you compromise we get upset about things that make us feel insecure  you spending the weekend with an ex makes your boyfriend feel insecure  that doesnt mean you did anything wrong  it just means that you have to decide if its more important for you to maintain your freedom to spend weekends with whomever you wish or to help your boyfriend feel secure in your relationship good luck  hope that helpsallison

   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,thank you for submitting this question i think this type of situation can be common for many couples struggling with how to keep friendships with past relationships while being in a new relationship for me more information is needed herebut given the information provided the way i interpret the question isim assuming your boyfriend didnt know you were going to spend the weekend with your good friend  working off of this assumption i would suggest beginning an open and honest dialogue with your boyfriend about what specifically upset him and to talk about your point of view regarding spending the weekend with him i would also suggest talking about how you both envision your relationship when it comes to spending time with others if you feel like you cant have this conversation without it going off track please consider seeing a couples therapist they can help you begin these important conversations that can help shape and develop the relationship you and your boyfriend long for

   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,that is a difficult situation and there is no right or wrong you both need to discuss it and come up with a solution that works for the both of you you want to spend time with your friend but your boyfriend  may feel betrayed by you spending quality time with another man you have been intimate with there may be a way for you both to get your needs met maybe you only spend short periods of time with your friend not a whole weekend or you check in with your boyfriend  periodically when you see your friend it really depends on the two of you if it becomes too difficult you may need a neutral party to help you establish appropriate boundaries around this issue good luck
2089,my boyfriend is upset about my friendship with another guy,"i have a friend that who i used to be in a relationship with it was brief and turned into us being just good friends
   i spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend was i wrong",relationships,its completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them  when you cross over from friends to a relationship it does change things  some people are very easy going and wouldnt feel threatened by what you did  others would be upset  if your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend then you need to talk about it  each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect  then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship  maybe he wouldnt be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend  or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him  most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward  you didnt do anything wrong because it doesnt sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend  but if you really care about your boyfriend then you probably care about making him upset  instead of looking at this issue as a problem try to look at it as an opportunity to connect  if you can both listen to each other and understand each other your relationship can become even closer

2100,should i message my crush,i have had a crush on this guy for years i last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school we left off on a good note should i message him and see how he is doing or is it too late,relationships,youll only find out whether or not it is too late by following through with wanting to message himregardless of whether the response you receive is what youd hoped to hear including not hearing back from him you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity youve had for some time
2101,should i message my crush,i have had a crush on this guy for years i last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school we left off on a good note should i message him and see how he is doing or is it too late,relationships,its never to late to let a person know how you feel  you never know where it will take you  you dont want to hold this regret of not letting your feelings known and wondering what if for the rest of your life   that can be torturous   now prepare for whateverif his feelings are the same or if they are not  if they are the samegreat  if they are not feel good that at least you let a person know they hold a special place in your life and wish him love peace and happiness in his life
2102,how can i be with the boy who liked me,theres this boy who asked me out awhile ago i said no because my friends and family would think weirdly of me how do i be with him and tell him and tell my friends,relationships,since youve decided to be with the boy who already showed you his interest then why not simply tell him you decided to accept his invitation to be togetherprobably your first concern about hesitating to accept this boy into your life due to the way you imagine your family may react if you do is the more complex matter to solveforming a relationship does bring up our values and the way these are different or similar to our own    at the same time we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew upyour dilemma of wanting to be with this boy shows there is a clash between your values as an individual including your choice of partner and the way your family understands the values which support being part of a couplestay true to what you feel whether this comes from your family or the way you currently are evolvingthis will guarantee that your new relationship will be built on the values and person you truly are
2103,how do i save my relationship,we have been together for a little bit and i love him to death but my mental health is so unstable i question everything he does from loving me to if my body is good enough im super jealous for no reason and my temper is super short hes pretty much done he said i have a bit more than a week to fix it,relationships,are there ways your partner acknowledges the difficulty to stabilize the questions you ask about your selfworthyour questions are typical for anyone who feels insecure and unsure  the lack of confidence you feel exists in many other human beings tooyour partners wish for you to feel better about yourself is fine   the problem is he seems more interested for you to solve the problem for his sake than for your sakeas long as he considers you an obstacle to his happiness and not someone he loves and would like to help improve their inner stability then he doesnt offer you more of his selfinterest than of his lovea week is an unrealistic timeframe to cure the subject you describeany time line misses the point of how humans evolve and not automatically changehe also is either missing or isnt interested in supporting your emotional progress
2104,the love of my life wants to try getting back together with her childs father,"about two and a half months ago i met a woman on a dating site we went out on two dates and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date we respectfully tried not to have sex but after hours of trying to resist each other we gave in and we had sex after that i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks then one day she went to her familys house on thanksgiving and everything changed within the short time we were together we got so close and serious really fast we had finally found each other we told each other that we loved each other all the time even while we were making love a few days after thanksgiving she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently i was very hurt and didnt understand then another week later she told me she couldnt do it at all anymore i was crushed
   a few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her so for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen she had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused she doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly i know she needs time and all i can do is take care of myself we have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again im completely in love with her and im in extreme pain",relationships,that sounds really heartbreaking it is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side it sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking care of myself while the rest sorts itself out while i admire your desire and courage to stay friends  the extreme pain that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you i would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you dont end up feeling strung along or resentful make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time  we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken

   a few days later she tells me how much shes missing me and lets get together for lunch or something like that then about two weeks later we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other in love not just sex but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her so for her childs sake she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen she had told me all about him previously and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged but she is torn and confused she doesnt even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly i know she needs time and all i can do is take care of myself we have agreed to remain friends and if this doesnt work out for her we will try again im completely in love with her and im in extreme pain",relationships,love doesnt hurtyour description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this womanin some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care aboutthis sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one  your descriptions are of the womans life parenting and relationship dilemmas not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long termtry distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday lifebeing aware of how much love youd like to give and receive is valuable selfknowledgeyour ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you being the result of the womans choices sounds like the opposite of lovethe relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes  it sounds like this is its main value in your life not that it is sustainable in realitygood luck
2106,why do i feel like i always need to be in a relationship,i have suffered many things at home and school we never went to the doctor to diagnose depression or anything like that but i always feel like a part of my heart is missing i try to fill it in with objects or in this case a woman,relationships,maybe the reason is not having confidence in the love you give to yourselfpossibly you consider the quality of your selflove as inferior to love someone else gives youthe best way to push through to your own selfcomfort and acceptance is to be aware of this tendency so you can remind yourself to practice appreciating the unique love you give to yourself

2112,i want to become a better man,im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her how can i learn how to listen and get myself together,relationships,the best tool for becoming a better listener that i know of is called imago dialogue it consists of  steps mirroring what she says without judging commenting refuting defending arguing or scoffingjust listening no matter the content and repeating it back wordforword continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesnt validating you tell her you you understanding why she feels this way if you dont understand then find a way you can also say that makes sense or i hear you or i get that empathizing tell her how you think she must feel about what shes telling you your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be herthis is a very different way of communicating than were used to my guess is that the arguments discussions and debates youve had with her have been counterproductive because youre both trying to win with imago dialogue you both win she gets to be heard and you get to hear for a changeat the end of the exercise switch roles for more info httpimagorelationshipsorgpubaboutimagotherapyimagodialogue

2114,i want to become a better man,im having relationship problems and i want to fix them to make things right before i lose her how can i learn how to listen and get myself together,relationships,the first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that so you are already on the right trackas far as learning how to listen try some of these stepsask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationif she has a subject that she would like to discuss consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience these questions usually begin with words like who what where when questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way you can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicatethen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience you could also start by talking about something that is important to youremember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesnt mean that you agreealso try sticking to one subject at a time its difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twotry to use the word want or wish instead of need saying that you need something or if your girlfriend would say that that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation that takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changesomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout consider thisdiscuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five   minutes or maybe even an hour when there are a lot of emotions happening each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceivingwhen using timeout say to your girlfriend or she can say to you i need an hour before we can go back to this then actually come back to the discussionsome people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way this is why the agreement is important before you need itwhile it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practicetry to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants wishes and desires while recognizing those of your partneras one final idea consider spending about  minutes a week together where you are not problemsolving about anything just connecting with one anotheri encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between youbest wishes

2120,how can i get over this girl i only knew for a year,i met this girl in high school she had switched schools at the end of the year and i have not seen her since its been a few years we had a very good and friendly relationship and we seemed to have a lot in common i never gained the courage to ask her out,relationships,one way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way youd handle a similar situation in the futuresince a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis right now youve got no idea if youd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years agothe relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner  that you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize  this way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property  to have lots of similar interests is another quality you appreciate in a partnerthe more you know about what you do and dont like in a partner the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path

2122,how do i fix my relationship,my boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction we recently got into a fight and he has become very distant i dont know what to do to fix the relationship,relationships,im sorry you have tension between you and your bfa relationship means two people who relate right   if only one person does all the work to change their approach what they expect what they offer the other then this becomes the new problem to solveif youve already done a significant amount of reflection and change in the way you relate to him then the next step may be to be patient as long as possible while he decides what to change about his part in the relationship toward yousubstance abuse recovery requires profound effort and reflection  if it is successful then the result will show very different qualities in your bf than the ones you know currentlyhe may be so absorbed in the recovery that he can only concentrate on this   of course if the fights persist and you have been patient for what feels too long then there are different questions to address
2123,how do i fix my relationship,my boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction we recently got into a fight and he has become very distant i dont know what to do to fix the relationship,relationships,i would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been or more importantly you have felt that he is  this will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyones perception can be different remember that relationships take work and take communication
2124,how come no man sparks my interest,i was never single afraid to be alone and i looked for my boyfriend to make me happy i finally worked on my self was in a relationship and i did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didnt work out now months later no man peaks my interest am i ready to date again is there a reason no one sparks my interest,relationships,yes of course theres a reasontheres always a reason for most dynamicsdepending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would gosince you already are on the best road possible for yourself since this resulted from your own introspection keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow

2126,im having a hard time with a breakup,i was with my boyfriend for years on and off we dated and broke up three times since we broke up five months ago i cant move on i want to get back together but he wont talk to me what should i do,relationships,probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for youwhen a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly  a break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life not only that the person is no longer connected with ussince your boyfriend isnt talking to you then youre keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions  theres nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking this person is the only one whos in charge to start talkingmaybe since youve had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before youre willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanentbe patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship  once enough time passes so that youre considerably past the point at which you and he come together then accepting his leavetaking will feel naturalright now its very understandable to have hope since youve been on this road before  in time youll have your answer as to whether your future is with him or not
2127,i have a crush on my bestfriends brother,i really like this guy and i think he likes me back but his sister is my bestfriend im afraid that if i tell her i have a crush on her brother she would loose it i once told her i thought her brother was cute and she got really angry ive gotten to know her brother better lately and ive realized he may actually feel the same way i dont want to lose her friendship what do i do,relationships,do you and the brother to whom you feel attracted ever see each other or are in surroundings in which the sisteryour friend isntif yes then this gives you the chance to find out whether you and the brother actually do like each otherif no then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact youre attracted to the brotherfind out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brotheranything is possible from shed like to warn you about qualities in her brother which you may not know and if you did wouldnt like or react negativelyor if protection isnt your friends reason then maybe shes fearful to lose your friendship if you start a relationship with the brotherfriends are people who care about each others lives  let your friendship with this girl work on behalf of each of you
2128,my boyfriend feels that i have taken advantage of him,"i feel like i took our relationship for granted and hes now to the point that hes giving up
   i have had trouble feeling like i could trust him but hes given me no reason not to trust him i know my attitude is also a big issue for him i have a lot of obligations at home so we dont spend a lot of time together    how can i fix this relationship",relationships,a key factor in a relationship is trustid start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bfdoes this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships or with a sibling or parentits also possible youre intuitively sensing you cant trust your bf bc hes not trustworthy  sometimes people sense the basic safety items in a relationship before they emergealso your bf may have similarly suffered broken trust and he gives off a feeling of not welcoming your trustits possible youre feeling his own selfprotection about being in a relationship with youthe best way to open these topics is to actually talk about them together with himwhatever the underlying tensions are talking about them always adds positive feeling and confidence to a relationship
2129,why does my boyfriend think every some i like means something about our relationship,whenever i sing along with a song that i like even if its just for the beat and not the lyrics my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship    i dont why he gets so mad and assumes i mean something negative from every song now i cant enjoy and sing a song without him thinking im trying to give him a hint he even accuses me of cheating and lying its driving me nuts i love him and would never do such an awful thing ever how can i get him to understand,relationships,well have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote herethis will give him the same understanding youre allowing us to have here on this sitekeep in mind that the best the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information is in his hands onlytry to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself   another path to open is to ask your boyfriend his reason to feel insecure about your love for him  this may open a wider discussion about what he feels hed like from you so he feels good in the relationship
2130,how can i stay strong,i have a lot of child custody concerns financial issues insecurities and weigh gain i also have no local family support its hard for me to stay positive i get very emotional and take it out on the people i love how can i stay strong,relationships,theres online forums and blogs some of which have interactive discussion groupsalso depending on exactly  what you mean by becoming emotional feeling overwhelmed by feelings typically happens when people feel a lot of stress and pressure in their lives   loneliness contributes to feeling overwhelmed tooyour feelings may be perfectly normalsimilarly depending on what you mean take it out on people you may be expecting too much of yourselfif youre expecting other people to listen to your upset feelings this is reasonableif youre harming them as a a result of your upset feelings this is unreasonabledepending on what exactly you are doing when you take it out you may be quite reasonable to do so
2131,i feel like my fiance still in love with his ex,i was talking to my fiance about changing my hair he recommended a very specific hair style then i found out his ex has that exact same hair i feel like he must know she has that hair style am i nuts or does this show that hes still in love with her,relationships,maybe your finances hair preference for you reflects he still is in love w the exthere are other many reasonable options toomaybe he doesnt know a lot about hair styles or didnt want to even think through the question carefully and also didnt want to tell you this directlyhe may have tried to take the easy way out of involving himself in your questionthe key whether or not he loves you is how you feel most of the time in your relationship   if most of the time you trust the sense you are loved and you love him then this gives you some reassurance about how the both of you feel toward each otherit is possible too that your finance has some remaining feelings for the ex   whether or not this makes any difference to you depends on how stable and reliable you feel is the love between the two of you
2132,im scared of losing my girlfriend,"my girlfriend recently started hanging out a lot more with one of her friends who did her wrong in the past and just walked out on her so for the past  years its been just me and my girlfriend things have been great up until the last month now she ignores me and texts and hangs oit with her friend more and more
   i dont know what to do anymore my girlfriend is so distant how do i keep from losing her",relationships,well if you each want to be with the other than no one will be losthave you told her about feeling slighted  start telling her about your feelings  how she responds to you will tell you a lot about where her heart is and maybe too some of the reasons she has been so involved w the friendwho knows maybe the friend has problems of her own and your gf is spending extra time w the friend to help the friend and doesnt even know you feel hurtyou would do yourself and your gf a lot of good to tell more about your feelings  either you will get more closeness and consideration or not  at least you will have the truth
2133,how do i start taking initiative in my relationship,i dont speak up if im uncomfortable and hardly ever make plans for us when we hang out he is a very open and straightforward person so he is getting upset with me for my lack of proper communication weve been together two years and have identified this as our main problem arguments have arised from this single issue many times,relationships,do you know what youre afraid may happen if you do speak upusually people dont talk freely because they feel afraid to do so  sometimes the fear of being rejected by the other of being criticized or judged by the other person or that what you will say stirs anger in the other personif you are able to know what your particular reason is for not talking then maybe you and your partner can talk about what makes talking easy or hardalso since speaking up is new for you then ask your partner to be patient while you learn to do so  everyone does better at learning new skills when they feel supported and welcomed
2134,why do my boyfriend and i have such trouble communicating,weve been together almost three years we argue and he ends it by telling me he doesnt love me its hurtful because i am all about resolving the problem and he dwells on the issue even if i drop what hes done and just swallow my pride and say i am sorry how can this be resolved we have kids and i dont want a broken family because we cant communicate,relationships,under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge so while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you in simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience and that still fell short of what you needed you are both still trying to get very early needs met the best advice i can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful and seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck pointavraham cohen phd rcc ccc

2138,im in a relationship and i think i like my exboyfriend who do i choose,im dating this guy peter my friend jennifer used to date him a while ago and shes fine with us dating my exboyfriend paul broke up with jennifer and shes devastated about it peter and i are going through a rough patch in our relationship all of a sudden paul is in love with me and he wants me back i dont know what to do because i cant hurt my friend or my boyfriend but i think i might paul again,relationships,hello the dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind when you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return is the person afraid of being alone are they jealous of your current relationship do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended how long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflectionyou likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship you will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance how it will it impact your current relationshipgoing into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm no one else can make this choice for you however gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist in your heart you will likely find the right answer learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it use your mind to analyze things but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too the answer will arrive if you let it
2139,am i overreacting by breaking up with my boyfriend because he called me a particular profanity,my boyfriend called me a particular profanity and i broke up with him this is the third time hes called me this and im just completely done with giving him chances he knows how much it bothers me i just want to know if im over reacting,relationships,it sounds like you are reacting to an issue in communication patterns rather than a particular word  the ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship  if your partner is not listening to acknowledging and remembering your wishes that is likely an indicator of some fissures in the foundation of the relationship
2140,how can i not miss my boyfriend while hes in ireland,my boyfriend is in ireland for  days and i am an emotional wreck,relationships,it sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close  do you typically spend most of your time together  if so it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart  if any separation is difficult you may need to examine why  think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious upset or worried about  if you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief   it is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend
2141,my new husband is constantly talking to himself,when i ask him who he is talking to he tells me no one but it sounds like he is holding a conversation with someone i have even accused him of having a secret cell phone i ask so much i feel like i am losing it is he trying to make me question my sanity or is he talking to himself,relationships,a rare topic  likely extremely troublesome for you i would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight feel free to email mei would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level  partners need each others trust and support no matter who is right or wrong
2142,how do i end an unhealthy relationship,"my boyfriend and i have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like i could never find someone better and that i cant be happy without him
   how do i get away from this relationship",relationships,im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuseone of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving safe and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgement rights opinions overall way of thinkingthis happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful  regardless of how irrational wrong mean selfish intimidating thoughtless a partner is to the other the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactionsstick with what your own intuition tells youthere is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going onleaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree  people are in familiar patterns of daily behavior no one wants to suddenly be alone even if this only means showing up as a physical body not as a truly loving partner no one wants to start telling others about a breakup answer questions about it feel blamed worry what others thinkthese are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heartlisten to yourself about leaving this guy your inner self does not lie to you
2143,how do i know if i am obsessed or in love with someone,we had great chemistry but then he became distant i had the feeling that i cant be without him as soon as i felt the difference i was scared to lose him i started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened,relationships,people often care deeply for those whom they love i dont know how long you have been together it is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to youit may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away it may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you for example maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he cansometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you you could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy you have the ability to write a message and he has the ability to answer when he cani also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened i dont know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your lifesome people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry but this is difficult for othersi would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved valued appreciated or specialalso think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argumentit may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first such as taking a  minute timeout if it becomes overwhelmingperhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person remember that feeling heard does not mean that you have to agree with one another
2144,how do i know if i am obsessed or in love with someone,we had great chemistry but then he became distant i had the feeling that i cant be without him as soon as i felt the difference i was scared to lose him i started freaking out if he did not answer thinking that something bad happened,relationships,the simplest answer is that love feels good obsessions dontlove deepens a sense of peacefulness and securityobsessions give anxiety and worry of feeling abandonedone suggestion is to study more about yourself and why youd feel so ill at ease when you arent w this person
2145,what can i do about my partners parents not liking me,im in my early s my exs parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me i left my ex due to an abusive situation and they are making me look like i was the bad one,relationships,maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future if you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex that could be one element of the discussion but it doesnt have to bei dont know how long we have been together with your current partner but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time that may be a discussion to have with them as wellhopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations
2146,what can i do about my boyfriends verbal abuse,i try to do everything right just so we wont argue and it doesnt help the only time he is calm is when he is drinking alcohol i get anxiety over having fights with him,relationships,because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fightswhen you do everything right are you saying that you dont argue it sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively i recommend working on this with a therapist though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm
2147,how can i make girls love me and not just the attention i give them,ever since i was little i loved the idea of loving someone and spending my whole life with them i treated everyone nice for girls i liked i would spend every second with them it always ends the same way i like you as a friend or i love your attention but not you,relationships,attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time maybe when youre in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with andor what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection
2148,am i unworthy of being in a meaningful relationship,im in a relationship but i feel like im always putting more into it and not getting reciprocated my ex told me that i will never find anyone else and thats lingering in the back of my mind,relationships,the most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter thats why it didnt work with him btw he wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered however it ended clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you so here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message move on you arent unworthy you just havent found a man who is worthy of you to be worthy of you he must see your worth often though before anyone else can see your worth you have to believe it
2149,how can i be less insecure and needy with my girlfriend,i blame my past relationship for it i know it is bad to be this way i want to get past it,relationships,we humans are social beings we learn how to be in relationship as children the caregiving you received or didnt receive set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen perhaps feeling like you dont matter there are many ways to rewire these relational patterns the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure  so congrats on that because clearly you are already there  next id suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities either as a couple or individually
2150,how can i be less insecure and needy with my girlfriend,i blame my past relationship for it i know it is bad to be this way i want to get past it,relationships,how did you come to the conclusion that you are acting needyis this what your partner told you or are you feeling this way about yourselfthe difference is that what youd like from a relationship may be very reasonable only that your partner is not someone who wants to meet your needsone way of evaluating whether youre actually needy is whether you feel that you give yourself love take good care of yourself when youre in situations that are not connected to being part of a coupleif being by yourself feels uneasy most of the time then probably practicing selflove consciously treating yourself with consideration and thoughtfulness may help you feel less needy of othersthis way when youre with a partner the time together will be in enjoying the partner not getting love because of not figuring out a way of giving love to yourself

2153,how can i rebuild the trust i destroyed from my porn addiction,i was addicted to porn since the second grade im in my early s and overcame my addiction during my separation from my wife of  years,relationships,the person who can answer this question is the person you want to rebuild that trust with  they are the only one who can tell you what it will take for them to trust you again  what they tell you may seem hard or impossible but unfortunately that is what they need  it is up to you if you feel and know you can provide what they request
2154,is it time to end my relationship with my boyfriend for good,he isnt violent but he has anger issues and deep insecurities hes working on them and has improved we started counseling and he participated in one or two individual sessions but we broke up again shortly thereafter now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining,relationships,from what you write youre not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own lifewhat keeps you feeling connected to him in positive waysif youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining
2155,is it time to end my relationship with my boyfriend for good,he isnt violent but he has anger issues and deep insecurities hes working on them and has improved we started counseling and he participated in one or two individual sessions but we broke up again shortly thereafter now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining,relationships,sometimes relationships just do not work  dont feel that the first second or even third relationship is the relationship you are suppose to be in for life   the one that is meant for you will require work but should be be draining and a constant roller coaster of breaking up  it is good you all went to counseling but one or two sessions may not be enough to make and see a change in behavior  it takes times and it takes both working toward the same goal  i would suggest doing youmeaning focusing on your own growth at the time  if he wants to grow with you he will make the necessary steps  if he doesntwish him well
2156,is it time to end my relationship with my boyfriend for good,he isnt violent but he has anger issues and deep insecurities hes working on them and has improved we started counseling and he participated in one or two individual sessions but we broke up again shortly thereafter now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining,relationships,hello and thank you for your question i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence i was a little confused about whether youre are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it i am going to assume you are still undecided some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse even without physical abuse being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing when partners question and accuse they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations  the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them for example if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring the person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong but it doesnt matter and that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again here are just a few things they realize there is no right answer trying to be logical with someone who doesnt want to be logical doesnt work many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway in addition the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells   the find support finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea  they reinvest in themselves try to find some time for yourself this couldnt possibly sound more cliché but it is actually true whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one one thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspectivei dont know if you are still in counseling but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great if not there are others you can try its important to find the right fit as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner that is a question that can only be answered by you but you could ask yourself some questions  like these to help you decide what are some of my values about relationships do i want trust honesty ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me or does it seem to bring me down if i want to stay in this relationship what are some specific things that need to change hope some of these suggestions help good luck to you be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc

2162,my boyfriend says he needs time to think about us,i found out my boyfriend takes antidepression medicine lately hes been saying he has a lot on his mind and he needs time to think about us weve only been dating  weeks but i like him a lot,relationships,this seems like two questions  the first is what may have happened to prompt him to back off  the second is what it means to you to have a boyfriend who takes antidepression medication who says he has a lot on his mind  both give you opportunity to look at yourself  having expectations can be a huge trap  i write about this extensively in the first chapter of my book living yes wwwlivingyesorg  is there any way that you can enjoy your time together without expecting anything down the road  are there wonderful lessons for you to take from the relationship  even if it only lasts three weeks  can you create a mindset of gratitude for what is and let the future expectations and future demands go  are there new ways to communicate that might bring you together  what are the lessons for you about allowing the relationship to develop its own course on its own time  again let go of all expectations and see what happens thats what living yes requiresi am sure this will work out well for you  either with him or without him  mark  wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg
2163,i am  years old with a baby on the way,me and the father of my child have been dating for a year we had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out but with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me now he wants me to wait on him to mature he wants to talk to other people then come back in four years he doesnt want to deal with me while im pregnant he doesnt take me to the doctor or anything i feel alone how do i handle this situation,relationships,well as far as your boyfriend sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice  leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned  however this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level  having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up  this is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do  hopefully someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listenas for you  how do you handle this situation is your questionyou do what you have to do to prepare for your baby with or without him  a lot can happen in four years and you dont have time are not required and cant wait to see what will happen with him  you have a life to prepare for  to feed to protect and to love  can you tell your baby to wait i dont want to deal with you now i need to mature i will be back to see you later hope you will be fine  nope   as i always say you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing  develop healthy friendshipswhether with family friends or new people who may enter your life  your support system will grow and life will go onwith or with him  stay focus on you and your baby

2165,my boyfriend isnt sexually performing like he did before i found out he was cheating,now that the other girl is out of the picture our sex life isnt the same is it because he is still thinking about the other girl,relationships,orbetter yet is it you still thinking about the other girl  i am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well  make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well  sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about
2166,is it bad that im giving my exboyfriend another chance,i was in a relationship with him for three years my mom doesnt like it because she thinks im making a mistake he got married a few months after we broke up and now he is divorced i forgave him for what he did in the past and he says hes sorry and he really loves me i love him too but is it bad that im giving him a second chance again,relationships,hey it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes your mom wants to protect you i get that maybe she is worried youll be hurt again were you hurt in some way by him can you understand where shes coming from sometimes when were mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom its hard to know how to repair moms relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong that the picture you may have painted of him isnt the total picture she might need help there thank your mom for her love and care and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether youre together or not that its a risk you are going to take and that you really need her support 
2167,why is he treating me like i am not a good woman,i am currently living in a hotel and i dont have a family i met a guy a month ago he is a bisexual he has a lot of gay friends on social networking sites he would not help pay for the room when i asked for the tv remote control he threw it elsewhere and asked me to get it i slapped him and asked him to leave my room we recently just got back together one time i was sick he came to visit and feed me but left no money then he texts me and brags about his house and car knowing that i have struggles living at a hotel he says that he has a whole house where he can put me in and orders me to text him whenever i need someone to have sex with he left his bath soap so he could come and get it i think that he is trying to find a way to come back please help me whats going on i am a good loyal woman why is he treating me like this,relationships,i am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends than about how you feel is treating you  you are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation  if you have friends to talk to please reach out  while this man has money it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together  it sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected  i would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care  this is not your fault  but you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs  take care
2168,how do i better handle my breakup,i got involved with my best friend who is married but has been very unhappy for the last five years we both fell in love and have been together for eight months he left the house and filed for divorce he decided to tell her about our relationship and she is willing to forgive and work on things this shook him they have two kids together he decided to put the divorce on hold he left town for a month to get clarity on the situation and see a therapist,relationships,hi miami i feel your sadness you might have planned a future with your best friend we live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection i believe that our ability to protect our relationships from the risks involved here has not developed fast enough your friend came face to face with what leaving the marriage meanthuge changes and many intense emotions he is wise to consider his choices carefully especially if you have children there is good reason to work at a relationship that is less than fulfilling therapy can helpso you fell in love with a man who was in an unstable place hes taking the steps to create some stability for himself and that leaves you on hold not knowing what his decision will be i love that you seem willing to give him the space he needs to figure it all out this decision is his for yourself you can accept that being best friends with a man might not be a wise thing many marriages dont fair well when friendships like that exist you flirted with danger both of you you fell in love but he wasnt free really im sure his love for you is real and powerful but its not a competition its one man choosing his life path you can focus on thoughts like thishe has the right to choose his lifewe flirted with danger by being best friendsi know he does love me this is not a reflection on my worthi can feel really good about giving him patience and the space he needsi feel proud of his honestyi feel proud if hes willing to fight for his marriage lucky herlucky kidsacknowledge and allow yourself to feel that sadness that grief its realif you have told anyone about the affair seek the support of that trusted person and know you have to grieve this in silence because it was born in silence i wish you well and for the record im proud of the maturity you show in this situation

2173,how to help my best friend get over a break up,im a female freshman in high school and this question is for my male best friend at the start of freshman year we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date he has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two i have nothing against her except for the fact that she has tims heart he is convinced that they are in love and maybe they are but i dont really believe him    lately tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year hes been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her but hes also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they wont have to deal with it when she leaves he seems really torn up about it and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves    he knows that i still crush on him he doesnt rub it in my face hes a good guy but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us how do i do that when the time comes how do i support him and show him that im here without wanting to hook up how do i make him feel better he is convinced hes never going to be able to love anyone ever again which i think is ridiculous,relationships,first off i think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him i think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things you can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelings and understanding regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upim not sure if that is possible if you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues good luck to you
2174,my exboyfriend put himself on a dating website because he thought i wasnt interested,i have been seeing this guy for a little over a year back in august he asked for us to step back for now since then he has still been in contact with me every day we spent some time together over the holidays but then i was gone for new years with family i came to find out that he put himself on a dating site when i found out i asked him about it and he responded with this my apologies if i got my signals crossed or if i wasnt honest with you you have helped me tons this past year and i am glad you are in my life i didnt realize you were still interested in dating again my apologies also is it better to say that i want him in my life or that i want him as part of my life,relationships,it sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other do you know what type of relationship you want with him a friendship only casual dating or an exclusive relationship i would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises by clearing the air and learning what your own and each others desires are you can then move forward with a plan without that clarification there will likely be false assumptions unanswered questions and confusion
2175,should i just move on from my demanding girlfriend,my girlfriend and i have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years we recently just broke up again last night on new years eve when we break up the very next day she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened she acts like everything is alright this has been going on for two years i do love her and care about her and her children a lot but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man she is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man it makes me feel like crap because i cannot give her everything that she wants she told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her is that a normal thing that women want or should i just move on already i am in my s and she is in her s,relationships,love is not enough to keep a relationship togetherthe people need to get along happily toolets start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partnerthe frequent break ups happen for a reason  try understanding more of why you go back together againyou state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship such as feeling like crap and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave hertrust your intuition telling you that these feelings mattersometimes men arent sure whether following their instinct is a right action to takeit isalso hoping a partner will fear losing them shows a wish to control a personcontrol has nothing to do with love and trust and these are basics of a relationshipgood luck
2176,how do i get my guy to fall back in love with me,i broke up with him three weeks ago because i felt that he needed to be more respectful he has since had a rebound relationship he says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me he says its going to be too difficult to see me every time we talk it feels like im being pushy to see him he used to be so madly in love with me but now it seems like he couldnt care less i think im running him away,relationships,hi kansasi think your first instinct was good you broke up with him you deserve respect but right now youre not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as hes moving on with a new relationship its appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants which is space do you think hes going to be any different with her this a common unfounded fear we have i wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him the bottom line is you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone be loving towards you because how someone treats you and the choices they make has everything to do with who they are and nothing to do with who you are i hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future
2177,should i let my boyfriend go,"im an early  something yearold virgin and my boyfriend is in his early s with kids hes cheated on me twice once in the beginning and then four months ago he wasnt use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasnt sure we both work at the same job where we met and its with the girl that works with us ive been trying to get over it but now my confidence and selfesteem are low and sometimes i feel like hell do it again or that hes not ready to be with me i think about it all over again when i see her he says hes in love with me and with the last time he cheated it didnt feel right and thats when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me hes contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because hes in a relationship with me
   how do i gain confidence should i let him go if i let him go i dont want to be sad about it being that we work together i try to tell myself im beautiful every day and i think i am a pretty attractive female with a great personality but i dont like the fact that she works there",relationships,sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationshipyoure on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriendsince he was the one who broke your trust he is one in the position of earning back your trustthis is always a basic formula for couples therapy in which there has been infidelityunderstand within yourself whether youd like being with your boyfriend and what youd like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationshipif yes then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationshipfor example some people who are getting over being cheated on would like knowing details about the affair person some people want to see the phone of the one who cheatedrecuperating after a cheating incident takes many monthsif he tells you hed like earning back your trust give him some time to see if there is progress in this areaas results unfold you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally takingabout the girl at work she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationshipshe has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to takeas you go along this road more than likely youll be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you
2178,i feel like i cant control having inappropriate thoughts,i find that i imagine things sexually and i hate it because it puts strain on my relationship i feel helpless and guilty i want it to go away and i want to make my woman happy again,relationships,it is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away however your feeling that you cant control having these thoughts is accurate its also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship though i would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you arent choosing to have these thoughts im sure that if there was a switch to turn them off you would flip itthere is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away however therapy may still have a lot to offer in working with a competent therapist you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away this may also be a result of work with a therapist either way you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner
2179,is it acceptable for me to find another home for my boyfriends dog,my boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago i love him but his dog is wrecking my house every day we get home there is a huge mess on the floor and several things will be ripped up including the couch hes slowly eating all of the doors and there will be food and poop everywhere even though i come home during all of my breaks to take him out he still poops and pees in the house every chance i cant financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house ive tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution but it never ends well the dog is the only thing we fight about because i want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesnt want to see him go its not the dog fault though i understand that the dog is only a year old and he isnt a bad dog hes just too big of a dog for where he is he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog i dont hate the dog but i just cant afford to continue having my house torn to pieces,relationships,every living creature needs time and support to adjust to a new situationthe dog is in a new place without the ability to understand the reason  this may explain what sounds like the dogs agitation  have you spoken with your boyfriend on his opinion on how to address the dog behavior problemsfinding an answer together would be a good way of making your relationship stronger  a lot of being a couple who live together is talking listening and deciding together on how to handle major situationsif it is affordable then a dog behaviorist may be of great help  the person would guide you in working with the dog to become calmer
2180,how can i get my boyfriend to see my point of view when we argue,i had to go to the emergency room today to get an xray of my spine my boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me instead he wanted to go do things for his friends while i waited when i was done he was twenty minutes late in picking me up he doesnt understand why im mad and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things he thinks i dont have a reason to be mad but i believe that i do,relationships,it is extremely frustrating when our significant other doesnt understand our points of view often times arguments are not the best opportunities to try and make a point as strong emotions can get in the way of understanding others perspectives try having a discussion with him about what is bothering you during a time when neither if you are upset or arguing communicate how you feel without placing blame and without yelling addionally give him ideas of what he can do differently so that he understands what your expectations are lastly consider seeing a couples therapist who can assist with teaching more effective communication techniques best of luck
2181,how can i get my boyfriend to see my point of view when we argue,i had to go to the emergency room today to get an xray of my spine my boyfriend didnt want to sit there and wait with me instead he wanted to go do things for his friends while i waited when i was done he was twenty minutes late in picking me up he doesnt understand why im mad and we keep bickering at each other over the smallest things he thinks i dont have a reason to be mad but i believe that i do,relationships,hi moore underneath all your anger is a lot of hurt the hurt is there because you are being disrespected your boyfriend unless youve only told me a small disproportionate part of the bigger picture doesnt tend to treat you like youre important and he dismisses your emotions this is happening because this is the level of ability disability he has right now in a relationship you can expect more of this behaviour because thats who he is it has nothing to do with you and i hope you think carefully about whether its working for you to be in this you could try telling him that you are hurt because people tend to listen more to hurt than to anger but my guess is with him it might not make a difference i hope you talk to someone who knows and supports you about how youre feeling in this relationship
2182,my fiancé is trying to hide that hes texting his exgirlfriend,my fiancé doesnt think i trust him because i was cheated on before however he hides his phone and has been texting his exgirlfriend who he has two kids with what should i do,relationships,oh chino i only have half the picture here so i will be cautious theres a chicken and an egg and i dont know which came first one thing i see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex because they have children can you accept that when suspicion and insecurity come along your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture is there any real evidence that he is cheating remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids has he earned your trust if so then its not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others hes not your ex reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that at the same time you can let him know what your triggers are for example hiding his phone doesnt send you a good message right see this is the chicken and the eggis he hiding the phone because youve been overreacting when he gets a text  so let him know you wont blow up about him getting a text if he doesnt conceal or password his phone transparency helps build trust you have sensitivities and it helps you a lot if hes aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear let him know when you get scared and hopefully hell give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him  
2183,what can i do to keep my relationship as good as it could be,my longdistance girlfriend is in a sorority and its changing her i feel like im becoming less important to her and it hurts she just wants me to support the sorority but its so hard i try every day to show her shes the most important thing to me but she cant even stay relatively sober at a fraternity party for me so that i wont worry about her doing anything regretful we love each other but were in a rough patch,relationships,you may already be doing as much as possible for your relationshipeach of you are  of the relationshipis the  which your gf contributes to your relationship based on the same understanding of the couples problem as you havemaybe a good starting place for the two of you to talk about is defining what problem the two of you have as a couplethis way each of you will be able to know if you have similar values and definitions of your reasons for being togetherdepending on what you each expect from your partnership you each will clearly know whether and then how to accommodate the other personthese discussions stir a lot of emotions in each person so that sometimes staying clear minded becomes very difficult  you both will likely feel like talking about these matters more than one timeconsider utilizing a professional credentialed and licensed therapist who would help the two of you stay on track with examine your emotional connections in a fair and safe waygood luck with understanding and appreciating your relationship
2184,im with someone but i have unresolved feelings for my exboyfriend,"every once and a while i think about my exboyfriend from four years ago and my current friend its like i cant get past it and i need some kind of closure i keep thinking about how we had something but it got cut off due to parental intervention nothing was ever wrong with it now weve become friends but theres this huge sexual tension between us or at least i feel it when were physically in the same place
   two summers ago we saw each other casually for a while but we never had sex then or while we were dating which was only for two months three years ago im now in my s and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his s despite the age difference i know were a really good match weve never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out i tell him everything also my exboyfriend has a girlfriend now as well hes been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing that summer i told him i didnt want anything serious and broke it off only a week later he had gotten back together with his girlfriend his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited im sure she may be different around him but i worry about him committing to her in the long run theyre supposed to move in together soon but still i feel this connection with my exboyfriend and i feel like he does too    i dont know what to do i need some closure or im not going to be able to move on from this i dont know what it is but its driving me crazy im so happy with my current boyfriend and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling hes such a good person i also know my exboyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things but i cant get it out of my head im trying to take a nap right now between classes but i cant sleep because my mind is racing ive never been so hung up on something for this long ever
   i want to just talk it out with my exboyfriend but i dont know if thats a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face if he told his girlfriend everything could go wrong because she hates me if my current boyfriend knew he would be crushed on one hand i want my exboyfriend to say no to having feelings for me but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too where would i go from there on the other hand i feel like i cant move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex but i dont want to
   please help me because i really have no idea what to do",relationships,if youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that although you say youre happy id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason thats a pretty important element to be missingit may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex if you feel the need to see what is possible there i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first you cant have everythingif you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship the grass isnt greener a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future
2185,im older and just experienced heartbreak,after  years i fell in love for the first time the person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye my heart is burning and i cant take this pain,relationships,ouch losing someone you love hurts so much we all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful while it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances i would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life when we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family while no one is going to be able to make it better we dont have to be alone with our pain if you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see  a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for
2186,im older and just experienced heartbreak,after  years i fell in love for the first time the person acted for a week and left me without even saying goodbye my heart is burning and i cant take this pain,relationships,hi san diego im sad that this was your first experience in  years with feeling in love you deserve better my understanding of todays western social cultural norms is that it is somehow acceptable to abruptly stop communicating with someone youve been seeing without explanation i dont get it its rude youre better off without this person around there are still people who operate with respect but this person isnt one of themif im reading this right you knew this person for a week in my humble opinion much heartache and many poor relationships come from attaching too soon it takes years to get to know someone deeply i know its hard to keep yourself from falling in love but you owe it to your heart to take these things more slowly because everyone puts their best self forward at the beginning and it takes time for that to relax and for you to see who they are when times are tougher and real stuff happensif i was your therapist id be curious about how this is the first time youve fallen in love or is it that you were in love  years ago  was your heart broken then or did something encourage your heart to close what has kept you from either meeting people or letting yourself fall in love until now is there a danger that you will decide love isnt worth the risk this is a crucial time for you to potentially seek professional support from a therapist in order to understand yourself and not shut down if thats what happened before 
2187,should i get back together with my exboyfriend who has trust issues,my exboyfriend and i met over a year ago we hit it off and fell in love pretty quick however he has trust issues and assumed i was cheating when i found out i was pregnant we had just broken up five months later i lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid i will hurt him again i just want to know where to go with this because i love him so much and i want to get back to us being happy and a family,relationships,im truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time when we are in relationships trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship  often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive  in situations like this i often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner  your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact if you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them  you can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses  in the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him  you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust  you may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well  but in terms of your question only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense
2188,should i get back together with my exboyfriend who has trust issues,my exboyfriend and i met over a year ago we hit it off and fell in love pretty quick however he has trust issues and assumed i was cheating when i found out i was pregnant we had just broken up five months later i lost the baby and we did not speak for a few weeks now we are talking and he says he loves me but is afraid i will hurt him again i just want to know where to go with this because i love him so much and i want to get back to us being happy and a family,relationships,trust is essential in romantic relationships and it is common to have trust issues  because the stakes are so high if both of you are committed and willing to be fully honest with each other trust can be repaired and become stronger than ever i would encourage you to seek out professional help as it easy to get derailed by fear when trying to work things out in the absence of trust when fear takes over  we tend to become defensive and act in ways that makes it harder to trust one another in addition to getting professional support i would encourage you to learn more about building trust in relationships and deepening connection through accessing various online resources on relationships
2189,is it possible to get my exboyfriend help forcibly,my exboyfriend will not stop harassing and stalking me we work together i honestly think he needs help to move on his accusations are angry lies but i think he may believe them to be true,relationships,the specific laws about this will vary from state to state  generally the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else or if they are unable to care for themself  more importantly is dealing with your safety  most states have laws that make stalking a crime you might want to think about filing a police report and obtaining a restraining order against him  you could also think about contacting a local counselor while you cant force him to get help with moving on from the relationship counseling could help you to deal with what is going on

2198,what can i communicate with a person who is sensitive to negativity in a disagreement,i know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him once he believes i am being negative i cant seem to find a better way of communicating in fact it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating    what advice might you offer,relationships,with any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc  begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense modethen share how you felt at the time of the event  just say when i felt kind of hurt  shocked or whatever the feeling was  period  thats all you should say  wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statementno matter what his response is stick to your same message  dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  you can even add i agree i could have misunderstood  it event i just know it made me feel uneasyhere you give him little wiggle room for a debategood luck  id love to hear how it goes

2210,me and my girlfriend of  years are looking for some free couples counseling in modesto ca,we have been fighting a lot and have  kids but we both want to stay together i need some help to save our family,relationships,hello i do not live in the california area however perhaps i could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling first i must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues including family issues if your girlfriend lives with you most insurances now cover livein partners as well if you have insurance contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is includedaside from insurance the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation do you belong to a church or other religious organization many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling these services are ordinarily offered free of charge to membersanother option might be to explore support groups within the area there may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group if you find there are no such groups in your area there are anonymous support groups online here is one such site httprelationshipsupportgroupscom
2211,i recently lied to my fiancé about my past,i find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about how do i figure out what triggers me to do this and how do i help overcome this problem i would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation,relationships,well lets start with the awesome realization youve already had you want to notice that you have triggers thats huge really i find that when people lie its most often as a defense mechanism which is likely a flag that something doesnt feel safe what exactly doesnt feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that its that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you it could really help to explore this with therapist perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty  thats not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers
2212,how do balance attention between my girlfriend and my dogs,i have dog obsession disorder and i am having problems with my girlfriend because i am placing more importance to my two dogs over her how do i get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs,relationships,hey dogs are cool they adore pleasing humans and often love to work on learning what you want and expect from them your girlfriend on the other hand likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours you are good with dogs that tells me that youve spent some time observing their behavior the first step in working through this issue would be similar start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building the skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching and keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships
2213,i have been in a relationship for a year and  months these few weeks have been bad,hes been losing feelings and he doesnt know why i love him very very much he sometimes thinks im obsessed when im not at all i give him his space and i make sure hes okay but sometimes i think if me and him saw each other more it would be better i truly want me and him to get better its kind of hard not to stress about it because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling hes a great guy i just dont know why hes been losing feelings towards me hes starting to put less effort in talking to me at this point ill do anything to just make us better as a couple i tried talking to him but he doesnt like talking about it much advice on what to do,relationships,im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear but id suggest giving him space ooph thats a tough one right i know but heres the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away he needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship its the work of being in relationship to learn this i get that this is tough stuff i wonder outside of being with him how do you soothe and calm yourself thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now
2214,im having a lot of conflict in my relationship,we do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says how can i fix things,relationships,being able to accept your partners influence is a key relationship skill and its very two sided  chances are if you dont feel your partner is being influenced by you they likely dont feel you are being influenced by them either the best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence  play with it
2215,how do i start talking again after a fight,i havent uttered one word to my boyfriend in days now im over it and dont know how to approach the situation,relationships,in any relationship it is important to be able to say im sorry because it shows vulnerability and openness i recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future if you find yourself becoming upset again i encourage you to take a  minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hearunderstand what your partner is trying to convey
2216,why do i keep getting with men that emotionally abuse me,"ive been abused emotionally all of my life and for some reason i keep getting with men that i let emotionally abused me
 how can i stop it i know the mistakes that ive made in my life im having a really hard time getting back on my feet can you help me please",relationships,i want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it  you are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  a lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way  until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solutiondont misunderstand me  the abuse is not your fault you are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed first go and buy the book boundaries where you end and i begin by anne katherine  read it  this book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it  you will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain thembe single for a while  stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own  often we get in a relationship because of a need  if you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons  the first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life  identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your owni was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife  this was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you  however she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship  obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies  the difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person  when she looked at him in our session and said to him i dont need you i want you  but not if you are going to continue to act like this  so you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes  she stuck to that too  he didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay  she had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left she was fully prepared to be single again  they actually did end up working things out in the endyou cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly  sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides  couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work  you may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you  a therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt but you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries  that means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you  someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone  if they feel they need the other person in their life these patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents  when someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know  even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people  something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome  be patient with yourself and find a good therapist  you cant change your partner  work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay  the more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become
2217,how do i choose between two guys,i have been with a guy for  years hes a great guy and we also have a son together the problem is that im in love with a guy that ive been talking to for about  years but ive never met him in person honestly im bored with the relationship i have with the first guy and he makes want to go after the second guy i dont know how to tell him that what should i do,relationships,hi there wow this sounds like a sticky situation however im here to help guide you through this decision first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child its very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because its the right thing to do right well not entirely although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run if you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating when a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions  behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such as a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child just remember what you do your child will model secondly do not sell yourself short from love everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with however being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need if you decide to pursue the second relationship i would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days finally i am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys this seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your childs father or not you should ask yourself if you were in love with your childs father first off if you were you would have never sought after love i hope this was helpful for you and i hope i was able to shed a different light on your situation take care of yourself
2218,dealing with an unfaithful and judgmental significant other,i have been with this guy on and off for  years at first we used to do things together and our sex life was ok then things started to change wed break up and reconnect and he cheated on me numerous times weve also had two beautiful baby girls during this time now we argue and he says i am not affectionate at all or i dont know how to please a man when i work parttime take care of a  year old and a  month old and cook sometimes he cooks but he also spends a lot of time on the internet in addition i have  boys and he has  son i feel somewhere i have lost something its not that i dont care i truly love this guy but im just tired of being the one who is always being judged please i am in need of a christian counselor to help us because i really need to speak to someone,relationships,i dont think youve lost something i think youve found something  your breaking point and its about time your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him obviously he has his own issues but i want to address yours i agree you need to talk to someone the fact that youve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better you do you may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve  and although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children what would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way would you want your sons to treat women this way thats what youre teaching your children when they see thislike i said i agree that you should talk to someone you can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he wont even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on you i understand its not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth
2219,my girlfriend broke up with me but i want her back what do i do,me and my girlfriend just broke up she said she loves me but is not in love anymore this came out of nowhere we seemed so happy together it all started when she went to missouri to visit her family the first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sisters house everything changed thats when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore i thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again then she told me to come to her in missouri so thats what i did i quit my job i dropped everything said goodbye to my family in florida and drove  straight hours to be with her once i got there everything was fine again  she apologized for everything and said she didnt mean any of it then we were good for about a week then she went back to saying she didnt love me anymore and had no feelings for me the only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant this wasnt an accident we were trying to get pregnant so all this is hard to accept i love her so much i have never been bad to her ive treated her the best i can i wanted her to be my wife i was going to propose to her when she got back now im losing my family and my mind i dont know what to do,relationships,i am sorry to hear of these troubles i see a few issues here i wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsyou say you never treated her badly and i believe you people in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on in fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy it takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workthere are two books that i recommend you buy and read one is codependent no more the other is can my relationship be savedsometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable you cannot change her and cannot change her mind sometimes the best thing is to let go if it is meant to be you will end up back together again it seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving i suggest backing off and letting her go maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind if it is meant to be she will come back if not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own
2220,i need help of letting go of a man who hurt me but its so hard how do i do it,,relationships,it is incredibly hard to let go of a relationship that was meaningful in your life even though you consider the relationship to be a hurtful one im sure there are some aspects about it that are hard to let go of ie time invested mutual friends positive memories etc so it is very understandable why its hard for you however the most important piece here is that you know that this relationship is harmful that is great that you have recognized this unfortunately some men and women do not realize the damaging and hurtful situation that that they are really inkeep in mind that the longer you stay in this relationship the longer it will be until you find the right person you are doing this to better yourself and your future look at it this way being in a destructive relationship is comparable to an illness or disease you are simply taking the correct measures to rid you of this sickness and to get wellit may also help to write down a list of negative aspects of the relationship and keep it close if times arise when you begin to question yourself or start to miss this person constant reminders of why you ended the relationship will be helpful to keep you on right track and in the right mind settingit will be difficult but its doable give your chance to start on your deserved happiness nowbest of luck
2221,is it normal for married men to fantasize about having oral sex with men,,lgbtq,it can absolutely be normal for men to fantasize about sexual activities with other men fantasy can be an incredibly fulfilling experience for you and your partner this could be a aspect of your sexuality that you would benefit from exploring thorough conversation with trusted someone like your spouse or close friend or therapist depending on your current relationship would you be comfortable discussing this with your spouse also please understand that this likely has nothing to do with your gender identity as one therapist posted here  a fantasy related to sex may have to do with your sexual orientation but not gender identity
2222,is it normal for married men to fantasize about having oral sex with men,,lgbtq,hello and thank you for your question everyone fantasizes about something in relationships it is absolutely normal to have fantasies of a sexual nature about other people whether they are real or imaginary this could certainly include fantasies about people of the same gender marriage doesnt stop us from fantasizing but it may stop us from acting on our fantasies if we are in a monogamous relationship it seems to me that you may be wondering if having these fantasies says something about someones sexual orientation it may or may not one thing that is important to think about is that there is a lot more variety in peoples sexual interests than what we generally learn about in society we mostly talk about lesbian straight gay bisexual or queer folks but there are actually many other interests than those some people are attracted to some men and women and yet they are married to one partner and remain committed and monogamous in that relationship they may still fantasize however  other people are simply curious and are aroused by the thought of someone of the same gender but they have no plan to explore the interest there are many possibilities and that could include the possibility of being gay or bisexual so is it normal yes not every married man has these fantasies obviously but some surely do where there may be a problem is if the person is actually struggling with their sexual orientation and the fantasies are about more than just curiosity and arousal if that is the case then the person may need help sorting through feelings that may confuse them hope this was helpfulrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much and i am
glad you enjoy it cross dressing is something many people enjoy and there is
no harm in it whatsoever my question to you would be what is making you feel torn
about it there is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with
people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the
majority and sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or
even in the majority but because people carry shame about being different when
it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alonebeing a sexual or gender minority or someone who
participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a
unique and personal way often means suffering from something called
internalized oppression we grow up being exposed to certain
assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even
face consequences sometimes if we dont fit in the way others tell
us to even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong we still internalize
them and feel guilty about who we are there is nothing wrong with us but
feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame embarrassment
or like something is wrong with usbut there is absolutely nothing wrong with you so be proud
of who you are and what you enjoy you can continue to simply enjoy it
privately or maybe youd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe
even join a community with similar interests ill leave you with a quote from
comedian eddie izzard who identifies as in his own words a straight
transvestite theyre not womens clothes theyre my clothes i
bought them take care and thanks for your question"

2249,how do i know what my sexual orientation is,im a girl and i cant tell whether im bisexual or gay i like girls a little more than boys but i dont really know,lgbtq,i think longevity has a lot to do with arriving at a clear answerits ok to not know and while you dont know read join groups which discuss the topic and most valuable pay attention to the way you actually feel around girls how being approached and approaching girls feels and whether this feels about the same as when you are around boyseventually the question will answer itselftry to avoid deciding a conclusion until your heart feels ready to tell you a clear answer

2251,how do i know what my sexual orientation is,im a girl and i cant tell whether im bisexual or gay i like girls a little more than boys but i dont really know,lgbtq,sexual orientation is not always something that is clearly definable some people look at it on a continuum where being attracted to only boys is at one end only girls is at the other and bisexual is in the middle anywhere in between those points can be any amount of attraction to boys or girlsif you dont know whether you are gay or bisexual that is okay a lot of people dont know for quite some time in addition to that after people do know who they are attracted to a lot of times they do not use the terms gay or bisexual for quite a whileits okay not to knowthink about what sorts of expectations you have for your ideal relationship some examples may include trust respect availability for conversation or connection etc whatever it is that you find important in a relationship is likely what matters mostif you are struggling with learning what it is that you would like in a relationship or any other feelings connected with what you are thinking and feeling i would suggest connecting with a local therapist so you have a place to talk about what you are experiencing
2252,my wife outed me to her sister,what should i do when we see each other,lgbtq,i am so sorry this happened  sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful  i might suggest depending on your relationship reaching out to your sister and discussing this or setting boundary that you dont want to discuss your private life  i might also speak with your wife and share how hurt you are and what you need to happen moving forward to begin to heal
2253,my wife outed me to her sister,what should i do when we see each other,lgbtq,echoing others here im sorry she shouldnt have hopefully you will have a conversation or in reality several conversations about relationship expectations of privacy are there things your wife would prefer you not share with her family without exploring what is or isnt okay through healthy dialog its entirely possible she felt her sister was in the circle of people she could share this with all that said though  now that youve been outed you have an opportunity to be more authentically you what will you do with it
2254,my wife outed me to her sister,what should i do when we see each other,lgbtq,i am so sorry that this happened  nobody deserves to be outed without their permission  i would encourage you to get in touch with someone who is supportive and accepting and plan to touch base with them after you see your wifes sister  you can also plan to take some time for self care after you see her  for example if you enjoy bike rides plan on taking a bike ride afterward  plan to do something that feels nurturing and caring  best of luck

2259,im afraid that im gay,ive been going through a rough time lately i been into nothing but women ive never thought about men until a week ago im very upset and depressed about this its not normal to me i looked at gay porn more than once to prove that im not gay i get the same results each time and i feel disgust this is tough on me im scared that i looked too many times i keep thinking about it and shake all the time,lgbtq,are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gaywhether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up and your own tolerance for being a unique individualexamining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effortthe more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it

2262,im going through dysphoria,i have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now this issue has persisted for  years already but i dont know where to start i do not have the soundest information either,lgbtq,wonderful  i am so excited for you  what a huge decision  i am writing from toronto canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically  i would start with two things  find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and  find a counsellor or therapist that is transgender specialized  they will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well  google is a wonderful way to find these resources   i wish you well thanks for writing

2266,im starting to believe that im gay,in middle school and high school my friends and family thought i was gay i tried telling them but they wouldnt believe me it almost feels like they wanted me to be now im actually starting to believe them i know i wasnt back then and now im not sure anymore,lgbtq,i agree with amy we get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we want at a pretty early age the truth is our sexuality can change and grow in directions we never imagined i may be wrong but i am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay that this is something you didnt like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true this would certainly be understandable your sexuality is yours and yours alone it can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are and it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself the truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation it may help to think about what qualities you find attractive what kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to someone smart funny loves dogs if you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not at least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire another idea is to chat with a counselor if you are interested preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy be well and be yourobin  j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

2268,how do i know if im transgender,,lgbtq,transgender means that you feel as though the gender that you are is different than the gender that were born with so for example if you are genetically and biologically female but you feel as though you are a male that would be the initial concept of considering whether or not you are transgender just in the effort to be clear the same idea applies if you are genetically and biologically male and feel as though youre femalethis goes beyond people who enjoy dressing in the clothes of the opposite gender although people who are transgender will sometimes do this as well being transgender is not about dressing up as the opposite gender but rather feeling as though they actually are the opposite gender and are basically in the wrong body compared to how they feel on the insidefind more information here httpwwwtransequalityorgabouttransgender
2269,how do i know if im transgender,,lgbtq,hello and thank you for your question first i want to say that i am a cisgender therapist and so i cannot speak to the personal experience of realizing that i am transgender what i can do is tell you some of the things that transgender people have told me and information that i have read perhaps a transgender therapist will also have the opportunity to answer your question from the experiences that i have read and heard the realization process went from either knowing right away to looking more like a journey i have personal friends who are  currently working through how to identify their gender and they are well into adulthood one person explained that the term transgender didnt feel right for them in terms of how they felt and believed that perhaps they are genderfluid this means that there is no rush to figure it out and many different ways to identify there are therapists trained in the affirmative therapy model who may be good supportive helpers that can assist you as you continue to look for answers ultimately i think the answer comes from within you but that doesnt mean that you cant get help to figure it all out here is a blog written by a trans male that i know sam is a popular writer and discusses transgender issues life issues and mental health you are very likely to find some good information in his posts httpsletsqueerthingsupcombe well be yourobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
2270,am i gay if i like neither girls nor guys,im a guy if i dont like girls nor do i like guys does that mean im gay,lgbtq,it doesnt sound like you are finding yourself attracted to anyone  it could mean that you just havent connected with anyone you find attractive or that you are asexual  essentially not oriented toward anyone  i would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel
2271,am i gay if i like neither girls nor guys,im a guy if i dont like girls nor do i like guys does that mean im gay,lgbtq,hi and thanks for your question i agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality but i want too add a couple of things about thathere is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality  httpwwwasexualityorghomethere are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality one is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex and that is not always the case there are variations of asexuality some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others dont also once you read more on this topic you may find that you dont connect with asexuality either and that is okay our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight gay lesbian or bisexual but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations keep exploring there is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do finally labels are important for a lot of things but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly this is your journey your experience take all the time you need you may never feel the need to label how you feel and that is okay too hope this helps be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
2272,am i gay if i like neither girls nor guys,im a guy if i dont like girls nor do i like guys does that mean im gay,lgbtq,no it does not necessarily  your sexual preference is based on who you are attracted to not what does not turn you on  if you find you have no sex drive at all this is called asexual  but you did not mention what you do find arrousing either  hope this helps

 my gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own i need some strategies for dealing with it what should i do",lgbtq,hello and thank you for your question i am so glad that you reached out for help i know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are you may already know some of these resources but i am going to share a few  the website wwwletsqueerthingsupcom is a blog from a very good writer that i know his name is sam dylan finch and he is transgender he writes about mental health transgender issues and many other topics i know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it you may want to check out his site and do a search on there  the website wwweverydayfeminismcom employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it if you search for gender dysphoria on their site many articles pop up it may be a good resource for you especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back  i am not sure where you live but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the lgbtq community so if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach in addition feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling an ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in  if there are some lgbtq resource centers in your area try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups gaining more support from others would be helpful sometimes lgbtqfriendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers  finally i know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal but i also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria dealing with transphobia etc if this ever happens to you please call  or the trans lifeline its free at  visit their site at wwwtranslifelineorg i hope some of these ideas help feel free to send another message if you have a followup questionbe wellbe yourobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

 my gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own i need some strategies for dealing with it what should i do",lgbtq,this is a difficult situation to be in as it sounds like you are feeling very isolated from both your family and your friends   i dont know your age or gender so please excuse any incorrect assumptions about you being under  and use what is useful from the ideas if you are older  one idea is to research online to find a therapist or a local clinic that has a therapist who is a gender therapist or a gender specialist  most therapists who are transgender affirmative also have other specialties and do general therapy  though i dont think lying to your parents is a good idea if you feel you truly cant talk to them about your gender then perhaps you can find a therapist with a specialization in gender identity who can help you cope with your gender dysphoria  you can let your parents know that you would like to see that particular therapist for other reasons such as anxietyworry and that you researched them and liked their website  work to find a therapist who takes your parents insurance if you can  you can also talk to the therapist on the phone first before you talk to your parents about scheduling the first therapy visit therapists can help you learn some ways to manage feelings of worry shame and fear related to gender dysphoria depending on your family situation many therapists will work to help you learn skills to safely communicate with your parents about what is troubling you  your parents may actually surprise you and be more accepting than you think  usually when parents learn that you are suffering they want to be open to learning how they can help you even if awkwardly at firstreframing is a tool that helps you think about your situation from other perspectives  its kind of how you can look at the same picture with a different picture frame and it makes the same picture look a little different   keep in mind your situation is probably temporary and think about in the context of your whole long life can you tolerate another  to  years living like you are if you have another x number of years to live  if you are living at home you will eventually be more independent and be able to make more of your decisions about your gender expression keep the idea in mind the concept that is popular in mindfulness classes i teach that this too shall pass or this is only for now when you start to feel hopeless if you start to over focus on your gender or body issues try to distract yourself with things that make you feel happy your pet music art sports etc or stay busy  if you can find any gsa or lgbtiqq youth group that you can attend confidentially further away from home to get some support  work to find an ally one person that you can talk to about what you are feeling making new friends online through social media can sometimes be a start in breaking down the isolation you feel another idea if you are under  years old there is a phone line   to call in case you are ever feeling you are in crisis  you can also text chat trevor project httpwwwthetrevorprojectorgthere is also a trans teen online chat group if you are  httpwwwglbthotlineorgtransteenshtmlif you are an adult you can get numbers to call in your state if you start to feel suicidalhttpwwwsuicidepreventionlifelineorgday to day can you creatively work on your gender dysphoria  yes  are there ways you can focus on parts of your body you love  can you focus on that when you look in the mirror  are you a writer  can you write stories or poetry about the life you imagine for yourself in the future  can you do small things that help you get more in touch with your gender day to day like making small choices about your clothing like wearing clothes that are more unisex  that only you know are gender related but others wont notice  you cannot force others to accept you but you can work on your selfacceptance and selfcompassion that work is something that is best done in the company of others like you as well as with at least another person who gets you and whom you can trust  good luck to you

2277,how can i know what my sexual orientation is,i have been noticing myself really enjoying watchingreading about gay or lesbian couples ive also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl and i like the idea i also find guys cute too does this make me bisexual,lgbtq,hello  thank you for your question  exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself  i would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi what messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations
2278,why do i want to be the opposite sex so much,i got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights i thought i was going to die then about a week later i started having this desire to be female i never had this desire before all i can think about is being a woman i dont get pleasure from my penis anymore either women are attractive but not like before i can also find men attractive now im too ashamed to tell anyone,lgbtq,"hello and thank you for reaching out to ask for help surely this is a very confusing time for you if you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself 
my guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence but i understand how you would make the
connection 
i have a feeling that a few things may be going on here it
is really hard to say since i dont know you how old you are etc but i will
share you with you some thoughts 
some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff
it avoid it etc is not always successful in fact its usually not 
its like telling you not to think of pink elephants i
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now 
so rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement where is this thought coming from what are my feelings
about it asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on 
one possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender i get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility and that is okay 
you can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion i would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues you can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website what is
important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are
experiencing 
 
i wish you well

2280,im questioning my sexuality,im a teenage girl i dont know if im straight bisexual or gay ive been straight all my life but a sudden rush of questions have come over me and i dont know anymore,lgbtq,hi brentwood while our society tends to want to put us into categoriesslotswhen it comes to sexuality because this is nice and neat and convenientmany people find that they dont fit perfectly into one or the other all you have to do is exactly what youre doing be aware of yourself and allow yourself to explore these thoughts and emotions both alone and in connection with a safe partner the people who love you will continue to love you as you sort through this you can resist the temptation to please others by giving yourself a label we are attracted to and fall in love with peopleand we cant always predict what gender they might be i love how open you are to discovering yourself keep on that track 
2281,i think i can become a transgender but how can i be sure,ive recently thought that i could be transgender but ive never had the mind of a girl,lgbtq,hello frostproofthinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different  this is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in lgbtq issues  from what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling system  while labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify they can also feel restrictive or confining  instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you  there are many options for you to find a therapist and etherapy is also an option  you can try breakthrough an online service   here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful  yin yang woman man httpdldbzejvk  what does it mean to be a woman or a man

2286,how can i get out of my head and stop obsessive thoughts,often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me once it starts the thought continues going through my head and i cant get it out how can i stop these thoughts,behavioralchange,scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real i want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddhas brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i dont have time to go into all of that in this response so its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought

valid   it is very unnerving when thoughts control your life 
one way to combat them is to figure out whose voice the words are said in
oftentimes people say things to us and it stays with us and it is not often
true  we let others opinions penetrate our brains and live rentfree in
our heads  you could try to rewrite the thoughts the negative thoughts
rewrite them in a positive way   for example you are not worth
anything you could rewrite that in a way that shows all the ways you are
worthy  write all your accomplishments and things you have overcome and
proof that you are in fact worthy because you are  you can 
interrupt the thought focus redirect elsewhere if you are replaying a
specific moment you could go back into that moment and retell the moment
rewrite the moment so that it is what you would rather it have been your mind
does not know anything other than what we feed it feed and integrate more
positive thoughts and actions into your routine to possibly see a positive
change a change for the better this video could be beneficial for you  negotiating with inner critic"

2291,how can i get out of my head and stop obsessive thoughts,often times i find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes i even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me once it starts the thought continues going through my head and i cant get it out how can i stop these thoughts,behavioralchange,hi therei first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal studies have been done that show that  of human thoughts are negative so you are not alone i like to think of thoughts as a tornado if you are in a tornado you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial however when you are lets say a mile away from a tornado it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe when unhelpful or scary thoughts arise we tend to start a war with them which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado this makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them so the question i imagine you have is how do i get out of the tornado there are  steps to doing thisget distance from your thoughts by adding i am noticing im having the thought that to the front of them for example i am noticing i am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me   the purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought these thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy the purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you dont get swept away by them you can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky and often the same thought will come back again and again but thats okay just continue to notice it with curiosity i imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely then breathe into them and make room for them our  main emotions are joy sadness fearanxiety shame and anger all of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them so again struggling with them ends up intensifying them instead let them be and make a little bit of room for them often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not the purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense contact the present moment notice what is happening here and now one way of doing this is tuning into the five senses what are some things you hear see taste smell and feel another way is to notice what is happening in your body without trying to change it how deep are your breaths what is happening with your heart rate are you coldwarm etcimplementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely so the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to youi hope this helps

2325,what is a psychotic seizure,my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one i neglected to ask how this was different than an episode i have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type ,behavioralchange,i do not think there is such a thing as a psychotic seizure however there is something called a pseduoseizure or psychogenic nonepileptic seizure basically this is when a person shows signs of a fullon seizure such as falling and convulsing but they are not producing brain waves consistent with a seizure psedoseizures tend to be brought on by high stress emotional challenges and trauma history you can learn more here httpswwwncbinlmnihgovbooksnbk still the best way to now what your doctor meant would be to ask them 
2326,what is a psychotic seizure,my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one i neglected to ask how this was different than an episode i have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type ,behavioralchange,the best path is to ask your doctor what she meant when telling you about your high risk for psychotic seizureyour doctor knows you better than any of the therapists who write on this blog   and because your doctor knows your health will likely have suggestions and advice for you regarding the seizures she thinks you may develop
2327,what is a psychotic seizure,my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one i neglected to ask how this was different than an episode i have been formally diagnosed with bipolar type ,behavioralchange,i will admit that im not specifically familiar with this from my own experiencemy best educated guess is that you could have a seizure during which you have some sort of symptoms similar to a hallucination which is one of the psychotic symptoms when you hear or see things that arent really therein looking briefly online i was able to find some information here httpwwwepilepsycominformationprofessionalsaboutepilepsyseizurespsychiatricandbehavioralaspectspsychiatricit sounds like this would be a symptom in addition to an already existing seizure disorder not a seizure disorder in addition to a mental health problem if it is the other way around im not sure how that would work it is common with some types of seizures to have an altered state of reality during or shortly after the seizure so that could also be relatedi would suggest you talk to your physician about this directly so that if they are worried about this you can learn more about what is making them concerned about it and what if anything you could do to lessen the likelihood of it or how to handle it if it does happen
2328,can someone with bipolar disorder feel like they are not themselves like an observer in their own body and not really in control,,behavioralchange,yesyou wrote a good description of one of the ways someone who has bi polar diagnosis would describe themselvesand this description is broad enough to describe the way many people feel when going through a painful and frightening life event or situationunless someone has been diagnosed with bi polar disorder then the description you wrote above is not sufficient for a selfdiagnosis of like disorder
2329,can someone with bipolar disorder feel like they are not themselves like an observer in their own body and not really in control,,behavioralchange,hello and thank you for your question what you are describing sounds like dissociation which can happen with folks who have bipolar disorder to a certain extent all people experience dissociation at some point but it can become severe for some people dissociation takes different forms  the feeling like you are detached from yourself and  the feeling that you are detached from your environment i would suggest looking up bipolar disorder and dissociation and see if these symptoms seem familiar if so you should consider discussing it with a mental health provider be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
2330,can someone with bipolar disorder feel like they are not themselves like an observer in their own body and not really in control,,behavioralchange,well one of the symptoms of bipolar disorder is having times of really highenergy and kind of feeling like they rule the world so perhapsthere are also some other things that come to mind when you mention this for example the person you are describing could be reacting to something that happened in their pastit would probably be helpful to speak with a local mental health professional
2331,i have had a compulsive swallowing tic for the past  monthshow can i get rid of it,,behavioralchange,the first step is to get a medical rule out that the problem is psychological and emotionally based not a symptom of a medical conditionask your healthcare practitioner their opinion on this questionif there isnt a medical explanation then you are free to explore the possibilities of tension and anxiety in your life which may contribute to the swallowing ticif youve been under severe stress at work  feel pressure in a relationship have a sense of wanting change in your life overall and unsure where to start these are each possible stimulus to a ticthe main point to keep in mind is that the tic is best addressed by clarifying  the life situation predicaments in which you may beaside from reminding yourself to stop the tic once you notice it a tic which is not a medical problem will go away when the underlying tension which supports it goes away
2332,i have had a compulsive swallowing tic for the past  monthshow can i get rid of it,,behavioralchange,i dont have experience with this type of tic but i can still give you a few general thoughtsi would first suggest meeting with your primary care physician they would probably be able to refer you to a specialist to see whether there is a physical cause sometimes there is some sort of chemical imbalance and extra communication in nerves and muscles that can be treated with medicationim not sure about your use of the word compulsive and what exactly you meant by it but it led me to wonder whether you feel better after you swallow and how often it happensit would also be helpful to see if you can recall any events or changes leading up to the time when this started for you as well as anything that makes it better or worsei dont know whether you are saying that it ties to anxiety or whether it is just something that happens and feels like it is out of your controlhere is some basic information about certain types of tic disorders and under the resources section at the top there is a link to a list of specialists httpwwwmovementdisordersorgmdsaboutmovementdisorderoverviewsticstourettesyndromehtmalso having awareness of trying not to do something can make it more difficult not to do it for example if i ask you not to think of pink elephants from the next five minutes that will probably be something you think about a lot in that time frame working with a physician and possibly a therapist depending on their recommendations about this may be helpful to you
2333,how can i control my anxiety when i have obsessivecompulsive disorder,,behavioralchange,anxiety resolves most easily when the person who has it does not try to control it anxiety itself is a symptom of feeling insecure and imagining control of an action will somehow create a feeling of peaceassuming your ocd symptoms are within range to affect only you and not other people directly then sometimes the awareness of doing a repeated action not because its necessary but because it satisfies your anxiety creates its own sense of controlinstead of directly controlling the anxiety you will be handling the ocd situation and this will indirectly calm your anxietyif following this advice is not effective then please dont blame or fault find yourself  everyone has their own unique qualities and yours may or may not naturally resonate with what i just wrotethen you will feel ready to see if a different approach will give you some relief  there is almost always more than one answer to a problem
2334,what can i do about those people that are so misunderstanding and judgmental,people always judge others so rudely,behavioralchange,i agree with you and this is emotionally painful to watch or be on the receiving sidedepending on who is the person doing this and your relationship to them it is possible to kindly point out that the person may unnecessarily hurt someones feelingsif you express your thoughts and give your guidance then whatever the person does afterwards you have the peace of knowing you tried to redirect this behavior
2335,i think i have a fetish that might be getting out of control,ive developed a really intense and unexpected attraction to an actress after seeing her in a ballet uniform while guest starring on a television show i try but i cant get her out of my mind what should i do,behavioralchange,why not make good use of your unexpected attraction to study the features you consider attractive in someoneattraction based on physicality is normal  as long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel and so long as your attraction isnt stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people then eventually it will lose its power on you
2336,the underlying causes of being possessive,i am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships how can i fix my underlying issues,behavioralchange,hi there its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive at the root of it is fear fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough all those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them the thing is controlling other people only pushes them away vicious circle right what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking you can start with this assignment write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive for example thinking something like im too pushy can be rewritten as im assertive and i go after what i want it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves if you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourselffinding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if thats not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there youve already taken the first step so keep moving forward
2337,why cant i change,i know im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life but i just cant seem to even though i really want to why cant i force myself to change,behavioralchange,hello and thank you for your question changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important here are a few things i would suggest get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that can be changed sometimes we will set a goal like i want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change  if you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it so if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual  if you are going to make changes really nail down why you want to make them what is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person for example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare knowing why you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there  once you know why you want to make these changes i strongly suggest setting small goals if you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse so make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person  as sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpcc
2338,why cant i change,i know im ruining my life with a lot of the decisions i make i consistently tell myself i need to make some serious changes in my life but i just cant seem to even though i really want to why cant i force myself to change,behavioralchange,in general the reason people arent able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to changewhat the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotionsif you havent got someone like this in your life which is common then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they arebe patient with yourself too  change sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change
2339,why dont i feel normal,i dont feel like myself anymore for example i could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving i feel like im watching my life be lived by someone else,behavioralchange,you may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization  people with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance or may not recognize their image in the mirror  dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic  i would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own  on my website i have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful  best of luck to you
2340,i did something i cant get over,"i was with my friends fishing by a pond i found a frog and stabbed it with my friends knife im not sure why i did it my friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me
   now if someone brings it up i get really upset and panicked i dont know why i feel like this does this mean there is something wrong with me",behavioralchange,the good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you   im glad you have awareness and im glad you are not at ease with killing frogsfairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violencebasically you did unto the frog what someone has or to you feels like has been done to youuse your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain   reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you   it is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realizedstabbing innocent frogs is wrong  it is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably haveit is also wrong that someone close to you hurt youthe direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships
2341,why do i think about how easy it would be to hurt cute animals,sometimes when i look at my pet cat i think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him it makes me sad because i love him but i always think about how helpless he is thereve even been splitseconds where i felt almost tempted to kick him followed by shame and guilt,behavioralchange,a lot of different things could be happening here do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is if you have not actually kicked him then i would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him what else is thereit would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you it could be that you feel safe with your cat so strong emotions come up because you feel safe
2342,why does my granddaughter instantly switch moods,she was diagnosed a type one diabetic two years ago and had a very tough time dealing with it she has an attachment issue also her mother just moved to a much nicer home and she gets angry and demands to go back to her prior home we do not understand what is going on and it is driving us crazy,behavioralchange,there are many possible answers here it could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable or dozens of other things will she talk about it when shes not mad you mentioned that she has an attachment issue it could also be that she was attached to the house its not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot
2343,do feelings of depersonalization go away,ive felt this way for two years i feel so much better now then i did when it started but it is still there in the back of my mind at all times,behavioralchange,best answer that i can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone it will come and go throughout life kind of like being on a rollercoaster here it is then its gone not to return for quite some time like many things the more that you fixate on it the more stress it will cause you consider it part of life accept it and move on now if your having many many many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at but for the most part nothing to worry about hope this helpsc
2344,do i have bipolar disorder,its been like a couple of years that ive been feeling like this i dont want to selfdiagnose but i get so sad and cry and then i feel better but then i get upset with people so quickly and i hurt their feelings its this constant rollercoaster and its hard,behavioralchange,hello and thank you for your question bipolar disorder is generally characterized by extreme changes in mood ranging from mania highs to depression lows there are different types however so here is a website that gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionguidebipolardisordermanicdepressionpageafter reviewing these symptoms if you believe you may have bipolar disorder then you may want to see your primary care provider or a counselor bipolar disorder is treatable but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management for example some people may not get regular sleep but proper rest is important for bipolar management a counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make the good news is that many people live happy healthy and productive lives with bipolar disorder so if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder it doesnt mean that things cant get better there is currently no cure for bipolar disorder but with proper medication and lifestyle management people can do quite wellhope this was helpful be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
2345,how do i deal with ocd,,behavioralchange,obsessive compulsive disorder can be similar to anxiety disorders assuming that you have already been diagnosed with ocd it is important that you learn to identify the symptoms the triggers and how to manage them different types of treatment have proven successful among them cognitive behavioral therapy can help you to understand the source and thought patterns that cause the behavior  exposure therapy could help you to manage the obsession by interacting with the objects that are the source of obsession other creative therapy techniques may help you to manage symptoms and help you to relax when triggered cómo manejo el ocd desorden obsesivo compulsivoel desorden obsesivo compulsivo puede ser similar a otros desordenes de ansiedad  asumiendo que ya has sido diagnosticado por un profesional de la salud mental el próximo paso es aprender sobre el desorden  es importante comprender los  síntomas relacionados con el desorden y que en particular los causa ya que identificamos los causantes de los síntomas podemos aprender a manejar o reducirlosse recomiendan diferentes tratamientos entre ellos terapia cognitiva conductual te puede ayudar a comprender la causa que activa los patrones obsesivos y ayuda a corregir los patrones mentales y errores de pensamiento  la terapia de exposición te ayuda a procesar pensamientos y emociones según interactúas con los objetos o actividades de obsesión  otras técnicas de terapia creativa te pueden ayudar a reducir síntomas y relajarte cuando estas expuesto a los mismos

   although he has this habit of lying compulsively and spending money he seems to be a good person hell always give a homeless person all his change no matter what my brother has epilepsy and is really antisocialmy exboyfriend makes an actual effort to socialize with my brother he takes him out to the movies and plays video games with him he drives me to school and work every day and picks me upjust basically the small things that add up to the fact that hes not totally a horrible human being is he just simple a pathological liar or is there something that could possibly be deep down in there",behavioralchange,it sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out you notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another one question that i would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist another question i would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him
2349,why do i think about death,i noticed lately that ive been thinking a lot about death i dont want to die and im not suicidal i just think about what would happen if i died or if someone i loved died i imagine how sad everyone i know would be i know it isnt worth it and i definitely want to live and have a future i just think about it when im driving i sometimes imagine what would happen if i just let go of the wheel and kept going,behavioralchange,ill respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving youll end up quite seriously hurt at the very least   it is fine to play in your mind with what ifs   people who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositionsif you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on deathsince you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in youplay around with your idea as to why youd consider how people will feel about you if youre not in their livesthis may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others
2350,how can i stop being so emotional all the time over worthless stuff,i was never like this recently this year my first year of high school i started getting emotional for no reason,behavioralchange,hello vancouver its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes the small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke if theres anger there look underneath that is it powerlessness worthlessness hurt shame  then ask yourself when in your life youve experienced too much of that feeling as a child maybe but not necessarily thats the first step and combined with empathy compassion and selfesteem youre starting to build what i call an emotional air conditioner a good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily i wish you the best

2357,how do i help my husband get over his drinking addiction,,addiction,acknowledgment from your husband and wiling to make changes is essential first  we often try to force people to make changes hoping that they will see that we are right even when they may not be ready  having a willingness to work together and be supportive is fundamental in recovery  if he is not quite there yet i would snuggest individual therapy for yourself where you have an outlet and can also gain suggestions on what the next steps might be if he is ready i would suggest you engage in therapy together and be ready to listen to him and what his needs might be
2358,how do i help my husband get over his drinking addiction,,addiction,its not easy to be married to an alcoholic and i want to extend my support to you  without knowing the pattern of his substance use ill accept your description that he is an addict the short version is that his addiction is not in your hands period however addiction is a family disease so you are definitely connected to it most people benefit from professional help whether they are the addict or the other person you might read some material from alanon to improve your insight into how addiction works within relationships it is safe to say that you are likely to have a role as a codependent or enabler the most common pattern is doing overt and subtle things that insulate the addict from the consequences of their behaviors from calling out sick for the person when theyre hungover to allowing money to pay for alcohol to simply remaining in the relationship these are all behaviors that make the addiction more likely to continue change is difficult for all of us especially when a physical dependency on a substance may be involved but the awkward truth is that not one of us ever made a change unless we were in at least some pain pain in our present circumstance is a requirement to achieve change by enabling your husband you minimize that pain let me state again though that his addiction is not in your control and its not for you to fix you can however change your own behaviors in ways that might change his odds even if he does not get over his drinking addiction as a general rule you will be happier if you stop being a participant in it many people find that an addiction removes the addict from the relationship  theyre not really there even if they appear to be at the same time theres a third person  the substance some people choose not to remain in a relationship thats constructed in this odd and offbalance wayi hope that gives you some thoughtstarters but i would encourage you to seek inperson help from a local provider and i wish for you and your husband recovery and wellbeing best regardskaren keys lmhc casac

2362,the organization i work for has told me i cannot go to my  step meetings,this is my recovery and i dont feel that it is okay for them to ask this they told me it is policy due to the fact that i may run into a peer there i am a peer counselor in the small community that i grew up in i am in recovery myself i was asked to come work for this organization after i was two years sober i was in treatment in this organization i work with mental health peers and run life skill groups i dont work with substance peers,addiction,hello and thank you for your question i know that workplaces have some latitude when it comes to requiring certain behaviors from their employees for example they may require you to tell them if you get into some kind of legal trouble but this situation seems completely different for one thing  step meetings are supposed to be anonymous i am not sure how they would know that you attended unless you or someone else told them i agree that it seems like to cross a line usually each state has an office that manages complaints related to employment such as the department of labor or eeoc you may want to see which entity is in your state and contact them it would be worth asking them to see if this is a legal practice if it is but you still wantneed to stay at this job then you may want to look for alternate sources of support for your sobriety there are active online support groups that would allow you to do things from the privacy of your home smart recovery httpwwwsmartrecoveryorg is a website that many people like there are also online groups that specifically discuss the  steps no matter what i give you a lot of credit for doing your best to keep your sobriety and continuing to see the value in having support robin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc

 is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed is there a legal case for failing to report",addiction,im so sorry to hear of your loss  this sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws i would suggest talking with a local attorney  that being said i see two competing issues here  on the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative  on the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm  generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesa local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation
2367,is there a lawsuit for counselors and therapists who failed to report a relapse,"i have a relative who is in his twenties he was in a drug rehabilitation program and got kicked out for using drugs again no one informed family that he was using drugs again he subsequently overdosed and was found dead
 is their accountability of counselors therapists or the halfway house for not reporting that he had relapsed is there a legal case for failing to report",addiction,i am so sorry for your loss  generally therapists only have a duty to report self harm to ones self or others if it is expressed to them  often times they will not report relapses due to the fact that proper releases were not signed or patient has specifically asked them not to for fear of shaming or failure again  i understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for  i would encourage the family to seek therapy themselves for help coping with such a loss
2368,can a past therapist disclose information to a current therapist that you are seeing,,legalregulatory,generally the laws regarding confidentiality would require a past therapist to obtain your permission before disclosing any information about you to your current therapistdepending on state law there could be some exceptions to this general rule for example most states would allow your former therapist to provide information about you to your current therapist if heshe reasonably believed it would protect you or someone else from an imminent harm

2371,is it ethical for a social worker to ignore a clients phone calls,i terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago i am now realizing that i would like to begin counseling again the social workers voicemail message says that he returns calls in  hours but he hasnt called me back i called him on the weekend and made it clear that i want him to call me back can he just ignore me,legalregulatory,yes your former social worker should return your phone callit is the professional ethic to do so and plain human decency to do soif he doesnt there is nothing you can directly do about the fact of his ignoring youthere are formal complaints you can make which you can consider doingwhat matters most is receiving social work servicestick with looking for another social worker who is willing to help youthe selfdoubts you mention may be worth examiningthey do not however excuse the social worker mishandling himself
2372,my boyfriend is in the hospital they wont tell me whats wrong and if or when hes coming back,,legalregulatory,i know it can be really tough when a loved one is in the hospital and you arent being told what is going onin general both federal and state confidentiality laws prohibit health care providers from giving out private information about patients to nonfamily membersunfortunately you will probably just have to wait until he is released or until you can visit him to find out from him what is going on
2373,unethical therapy practices,what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation,legalregulatory,this sounds like a potentially serious situation the most important thing is to make sure the child is safe  if you suspect that a child is or has been harmed i would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to child protective services if you dont think that a child is in danger you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board
2374,unethical therapy practices,what do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parents custody visitation,legalregulatory,i will admit i am confused about this question are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication most therapists wont even get involved in a custody battle they know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board every therapist is licensed in their state there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensuremost accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this if this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but dont try to ruin someones career unless you are sure this occurred
2375,is it a normal practice for a team of doctors who are connected by state or profession to discontinue your treatment,they discontinued treatment for no apparent reason after they thought to diagnose me with schizophrenia,legalregulatory,the general rule against medical abandonment says thst whenever healthcare providers discontinue treatment with you when you still need it they are legally required to make sure that you have access to another provider of equal or higher abilityin this case if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment if you havent already done so id recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral
2376,is there anything i can do about my therapist blocking my psychiatric services,i had a dispute with my therapist regarding an appointment cancellation now she is blocking me from seeing other psychologists at the same clinic which takes my insurance which is also where i get my psychiatric services there is a strict  hour cancellation policy and my appointments are at  on tuesday i called to cancel at  the previous friday i was late so we contacted my doctor to tell her that i would be out of town she said i could do a phone in session the thing is we do double sessions,legalregulatory,my recommendation would be to try to talk to your therapist about this  from your description it sounds like you have a legitimate explanation for missing your scheduled session maybe if you could explain that to her she would be willing to work with you if she is not willing to consider your explanation and if she is not willing to continue working with you she still has an ethical obligation to provide you with referral resources to another therapist
2377,can i go see a psychiatrist without my dad finding out even if i am on his insurance,,legalregulatory,it might be possible but its difficult first  depending on how old you are you might be able to restrict  a  mentalhealth  provider from disclosing your confidential information to your parents the age at which you can do this is different from state to state the range is generally anything from age  to age   second even if you are old enough to to be able to tell your provider not to give any information to your parents they will probably find out if you use their insurance it seems like you might have a few options you might want to try talking to your dad about seeing a psychiatrist he might be supportive you could also try talking to a counselor or nurse at your school they could also help you find some confidential options i hope this helps
2378,how can i see if a therapist if my mom cant afford it,i think i have depression anxiety bipolar disorder and i have anger issues i told my mom over and over again she told me she would get me a therapist but she never did i just found out that my mom cant afford a therapist for me,legalregulatory,it can be difficult to get counseling if you dont feel supported by family members  there might be a few options  if you are in school id recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse  they often will be able to help you access free or affordable counseling resources in your community  in addition depending on where you live its also often possible to call  for referrals to free or low cost counseling services in your areaid encourage you not to give up you are on the right track
2379,i told my family doctor yesterday that i am hoarding my ativan pills is he legally required to tell my psychiatrist or therapist,i have major depression severe ptsd anxiety disorder and personality disorder i had an appointment with my doctor i was very upset and i shared with him about that particular drug,legalregulatory,your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist  especially if your doctor is concerned about your safetyit was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on  i know that must have been difficult to talk about with him  by having that conversation you are helping your primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your health
2380,in the state of new york is it legal for someone to record a counseling session without telling the counselor or the other person in the session,,legalregulatory,in new york like most states the law generally is whats called a oneparty consent rule this means that in most cases it is legal to record a conversation as long as consent has been granted by at least one person involved in the conversationit probably would not be illegal for a client to secretly record a counseling session without the consent of the counselor since only one persons consent is required it would be sufficient that the client consentedon the other hand it would probably be illegal for a third party to record a counseling session without the consent of the counselor or the clientsimilarly it would be a violation of ethical standards and maybe a violation of law for a counselor to secretly record a session without the clients consent
2381,how do i a lpc start an online practice,,legalregulatory,this is a great question  especially since technology assisted counseling is definitely the current growing edge of the fieldthere are a few things youll want to look into before starting an online practice check out your state laws regarding online counseling  keep in mind there are different terms used in different states including technology assisted or distance counseling so it might take a little searching to find your states rules  some states have extensive regulations regarding the scope of practice informed consent documentation etc  other states do not have any specific laws or policies regarding online counseling at all next its a good idea to review the  aca code of ethics and the  amhca code of ethics both have extensive new sections addressing the ethics of online counseling lastly youll need to look into the law in the states where your potential clients are located  this is really important since nearly every state considers counseling to occur in both the location of the client and the location of the counselor  for example new york has a law that specifically requires any counselor who is providing online counseling services to a client in the state to be licensed by new york
2382,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,there are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated client has met therapy goals client is not progressing  therapist is not a good fit for clientin order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what isnt and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client in these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea
2383,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,it is usually time to end counseling sessions when it is clear to both the client and the counselor that therapeutic goals have been reached and enough improvement has been made that the client can continue without that support there are exceptions to this rule but for the most part this is when counselors begin termination for some clients this is an easy process that marks the achievements they have made in working through their emotions and difficulties for some other clients however this is a difficult process in which they are losing a valuable support and are understandably anxious about what life will be like without the frequent meetings ultimately termination is different for everyone and there are many ways that termination can be healthy and helpful
2384,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,hello the end of the counselorclient relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons among them are the clients inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinicians inability to help the client for a variety of reasons a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere in this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the clients inability to pay that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramountwhen the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journeyrather than some abrupt departure from it an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known albeit perhaps approximate date of when that program will be finished in this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolutioni have always worked in therapy with the following slogan if you will that i learned years ago during graduate school not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality  the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapists desire to truly see the client heal and grow when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward in these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clearultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client which is paramount are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere if both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the clients successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter
2385,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions its really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions sometimes however a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselors expertise thats a good time for a conversation about those needs and ideas of  how best to meet them whether by adding in care with an additional mental health professional or transferring care entirely to a new mental health provider
2386,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor  follows through

2389,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,counselors should consider ending counseling sessions or terminating therapy under several different circumstances here are a few of the most commonif the client has developed the coping skills for which they came to therapy counselors should encourage clients to decrease sessions to less often to begin practicing maintaining progress on their own clients are often nervous about decreasing sessions when they are doing well for fear of relapsing this is a crucial step in helping clients to build confidence in their coping skills and decrease the feeling that they must forever continue therapy in order to be well most clients experience some difficulties and slip ups during this step down process but these are important to identify and address while still in therapy where clients can get help coming up with a plan this is also the point at which counselors should be helping clients come up with a relapse prevention plan so they can safely terminate therapy and maintain the progress on their ownif the counselor determines the clients needs are outside of their scope of practice they should refer them out for example if the counselor determines that the client has an eating disorder and the counselor is not knowledgable or trained in the treatment of eating disorders they should refer them to another provider who specializes in this issueif the client is in need of a higher level of care counselors should refer them to the lowest level that is likely to be effective for the client most of what we think of as therapy is often on session every week or two with a therapist at a local practice for some clients however the therapist may find they are unable to manage their symptoms and emotions between sessions and need to be seen more frequently for outpatient therapy clients with more severe symptoms are typically seen twice a week for clients who need more than that counselors should refer them to other programs for more intensive treatment such as intensive outpatient groups and individual therapy several times per week partial hospitalization groups and individual therapy several hours per day plus medication or inpatient residential treatment with groups individual therapy and medication for  daysif the client is in need of substance abuse treatment before therapy can be effective with other concerns the counselor should refer clients for a substance abuse evaluation people commonly use substances to cope with unwanted emotional pain and mental health symptoms over time this pattern often develops into substance abuse research has shown therapy to be ineffective in treating mental health conditions without first addressing any substance abuse for example someone with a history of trauma who is drinking to cope with unwanted memories would need to be able to maintain sobriety for a period of time before therapy for trauma can have any significant impactmy goal as a therapist is always to start people off with the lowest frequency of sessions possible for them to actually make progress typically once a week or once every other week then we work to teach them the skills they came in for and encourage them to practice outside of sessions next once theyve gotten the hang of the skills and are feeling better we start encouraging them to space out sessions and take the training wheels off finally we come up with a relapse prevention plan to make sure they can keep it going on their own and identify any impending relapses long before they get bad so they can course correct on their ownfor more information about the process of cbt therapy visit from start to finish what does cognitive behavioral therapy look like

2398,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,there are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling  a major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client  this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time  if the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy  the process of termination must not injure the client and if necessary the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities  another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care  if the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else he or she may need a higher level of care  in this circumstance the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit  a third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship  for example if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship  in this instance the clinician should refer the client to another therapist  finally if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment the clinician and client should terminate treatment

2400,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,"goodbyes can be hard
chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been
difficult saying goodbye to a therapist can be different it can be an
opportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life
if you work with a therapist who is skilled then saying goodbye can be just as
transformative as the therapy itself ending therapy is also known
as termination i know termination doesnt have a great ring to it
however it is what it is it is an ending of the relationship as it existed
it is reality cold and stark of course when i talk to clients i dont use the
word termination i usually say our goodbye  under what circumstances does therapy usually
end therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is not
receiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to work
with a particular therapistin the best case scenario
the decision to move on from therapy and say our goodbyes happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up  ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session what i mean by that
is there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently so the first session i
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve now sometimes there are
situations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may take
that personally it is hard when any relationship ends and it might bring up
feelings of sadness and fear or abandonment any good therapist will end the
relationship based on what is right for the client what are some situations
where a therapist might end the relationshipif the situation the client
is dealing with is out of the therapists scope of practice the therapist may
end the relationship and refer the client to someone else this is in the
clients best interest another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful  a therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce a good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else this is good practice
and helps the clientif a client is actively
suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the
relationship and refer out for a higher level of care the client may need to
be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program
therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after
the intensive program is completed 
ending therapy should be a
time for connection and bringing together accomplishments or reviewing the
next important step the client needs to take it should not be an experience of
abandonment a skilled therapist will help a client gain a new perspective on
closure for some clients it may be the one time in their lives when they get
a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of
control on creating that ending good luck to you"
2401,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,in the best case scenario its a mutual discussion and decision if not  ive had the discussion initiated both ways by me when i sense the client has gone has far as they want by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments missing or cancelling appointments usually at the last minute lack of participation during sessions  client initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments by forgetting their calendar or their checkbook   by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals once a week to once a month for example  i rarely have had to terminate a working relationshipthats why i dont charge for the first visit so we know if we are a good fit before we start working together  then i periodically ask whether the client feels we are making progress moving in the right direction talking about the most relevant issues etc
2402,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,in my therapy practice the decision to end therapy is mutually made together with the patientotherwise the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonmentthe way youll both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easilythe persons mood will be better they will smile more sit in their seat in a more relaxed way look more at ease take better care of their appearanceone of the ways to end therapy is to gradually decrease the frequency of the sessionssometimes people who are in my practice start to come each three weeks then monthly then every three monthsthis gives a sense of security friendliness and casualness to the therapy and demedicalizes it as though the person was treated for a medical symptom and the symptom stops completely one daytalk therapy is about life and life problems usually end graduallyi end my therapy in a way which mirrors the life process in which many interaction and situation problems show their effects gradually and show different effects over time
2403,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,hi there there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship  the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed  all of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last example your question however was about the counselor ending treatment this is a bit more difficult and can be very nervewracking  it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well  its important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something elsein regular openended sessions i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently in these checkins i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely  i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize  in goaloriented sessions i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy  this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery that said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these up in the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you its a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward
2404,how does counseling end,how does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client,professionalethics,this is a question that is very specific to each person there are definitely some variables but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might endwhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication this depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyim not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning i strongly encourage you to ask about it

2413,what is the proper procedure if your childs therapist is leaving the practice to work elsewhere,,professionalethics,generally speaking therapists are obligated to help their clients connect with a new therapist should they require ongoing support and the therapist is no longer able to continue working with them this may simply mean that the therapist provides some names and numbers for other therapists or agencies that may be appropriate for your child if the therapist is leaving one practice for another and is able to continue seeing the client than that may be arranged and is often the most desired outcome for the sake continuity sometimes partners or employers in the original practice may expect and require clients of the practice to be transferred to another therapist within that practice instead of being taken to a new practice

2417,what is the proper procedure if your childs therapist is leaving the practice to work elsewhere,,professionalethics,ask the therapist first  they will either tell you how to continue with them in the new job or give you a referral  they also will help your child with the transition  if that fails ask the agency where your child sees the therapist about next steps  theres an agency director or equivalent who will probably be happy to help you if that fails and i hope it doesnt consider finding a therapist on your own  if the therapist is not helping or is behaving unethically contact the state agency which issues the therapists license for help and to let them know about your experience  that will protect the next parent  good luck  mark wwwmarkmorrislcswcom and wwwlivingyesorg

2436,is it bad to fantasize about my mom,,humansexuality,hello and thank you for your question there are a couple of things i want to mention and some other colleagues may add other types of information i want to talk about fantasies an internal behavior not known by others versus external behaviors that others can see and your specific question about fantasizing about a parent i am going to assume that you are meaning sexual fantasies and i apologize if that is not your meaning it is important to remember that we may fantasize about a bunch of things that we would never do someone may fantasize about punching his boss right in the nose but would never do it and not just because of the consequences but because they genuinely would not want to hurt someone in real life it is also true that some people fantasize about things as a way to work up to doing the actual thing they want to do you may be in one of  these categories the specific issue of fantasizing about a mother is something  commonly found in sigmund freuds theories about psychosexual development he called it the oedipus complex and determined it is generally found in early childhood development but can move into adulthood the reason i am sharing this with you isnt to make you a psychology major but rather so that you will know that you are not the only person to have such fantasies in adulthood something to think about is whether or not you should feel guilty about fantasies of course if the answer is yes you may find yourself feeling guilty a lot of the time or should you only concern yourself with behaviors that others can actually see or be affected by for example should you only be concerned if you are actually planning on acting on one of your fantasies toward your mother the answer to that could certainly be yes since someone acting on their fantasies would certainly impact someone else sometimes our minds will have a fantasy and we recognize that it is taboo and when that happens it is possible that we will actually fantasize about it more that is also a possibility here too you may have had a rogue fantasy that has now taken root  the most important thing i am trying to get across to you is that there may be many reasons for these fantasies and they dont all lead to them or you being bad if you have real concerns about what this may mean about you as a person you may want to go to a counselor this is especially true if you think you want to act on these fantasies and you know that would be harmful there are many possible explanations for these fantasies and a counselors office may be the safest place to explore them be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
2437,why do i get aroused when women call me gay,is it a type of fetish or is it normal,humansexuality,maybe it is a way to secretly satisfy your own wish to be or to live life gay
2438,why do i have sexual urges for my sister,,humansexuality,without knowing more details about your personal family dynamics and your age i am only able to guessmaybe the reason is because she looks attractive to you   whether this means anything more than a fleeting fantasy moment or if it is more serious depends for how long youve felt this way toward hersexual urges are sometimes hidden wish to be nurtured   if your sister reminds you of a loving presence then your sexual urge for her may really reflect your need to be nurtured not necessarily sexually satisfiedbasically give yourself the mental freedom to let your mind wander as to your own theory on your questionwhen the find the answer which feels accurate youll have a sense of having reached your answer
2439,is there a reason i have always been attracted to men much older then me,i am a young adult and i was sexually assaulted by an older man when i was a teenager which has really intensified the guiltshame however ive been attracted to much older men since i was even younger than that,humansexuality,sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distantif you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know youd have liked more and didnt receive this then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within youit is ok to like older menjust be sure youre not idealizing them or anyone elsebecause regardless of age a relationship is based on who the two people really are not how wed like imagining them
2440,how do i deal with sexual tension,i have been experiencing a lot of sexual tension with a lot of the guys that i talk to nowadays i keep imagining having sex with them i have never had sex before nor have i had a boyfriend i feel lonely and empty i feel like my body is not okay and i am missing something i talk to so many boys in school and i always fantasize about half of them i want this feeling to stop because it is interfering with my time to study since most of the time i am busy thinking about sex,humansexuality,hi montreal im glad you wrote what youre experiencing is normal were sexual beings we have a builtin desire to connect sexually with others because it feels good to keep procreation going and mostly to connect with other people because connecting with others makes us feel fulfilled and valuable sexual desire is a healthy part of you maybe your body is telling you it wants to dive into that water and taste it instead of just staring at it it sounds like youre beginning to explore yourself sexually and thats okayat your young age you also have another innate burning desire and that is to know yourself i see both of these desires burning and competing in you its a bit of a crazy timeyou want to connect with others but youre not sure who you are or what you want from them you want to know yourself but you cant learn about yourself in a vacuum its okay to trust your instincts its okay to connect sexually with others as long as youre preventing disease and pregnancy and you know how to protect your boundaries but even as i write this i think maybe im being controlling and overprotective of you its your body and youre in charge of what happens to it but i do want you to be safewhatever that means to you maybe talk to someone you trust with each encounter you have with other people sexual or not you will learn more about yourself and what you want both sexually and just in relationship or friendship you will develop a sense of who you arehave you tried to get to know yourself sexually this is a super place to start and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others when you explore your own body what feels good what brings you to orgasm i wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely 
2441,how can i get some closure on an experience i regret,back in high school my friend and i used to masturbate around each other i hate even talking about it now because its so weird we didnt even realize how messed up it was at the time one time it escalated and we ended up doing it for each other it wasnt supposed to be a gay thing but it sure sounds like it now that i talk about it i pushed this away until it recently came up in my head again im having a lot of trouble,humansexuality,writing about your high school masturbation times with your friend is itself a form of acknowledging the full picture of who you are   you are doing well to reflect on your actions in the truthful way you are doingalso positive is that you have perspective that at your age and social maturity you were innocently doing something that in adult terms would be considered in a negative waymaybe through your more mature minds eye of today you can feel some compassion and understanding for your high school self  this way your sense of selfjudgment may start to dissolve a little bit more
2442,how can i control my sexual urges,,humansexuality,anything can become an addiction  eating gambling shopping sex even exercising  it sounds like this has become a behavioral addiction for you  a therapist can help you identify the underlying reasons and help you learn to control the urges and develop healthier coping skills people turn to an activity that makes them feel better when something is bothering them emotionally or mentally  anything can become a problem if you overuse it  this is why it is important to have a healthy balance of activities in your life more than one thing that you can turn to in order to help you cope  addictions are formed when we turn to the same thing over and over again  sex is a very powerful addiction for some people  it makes us feel good  we get pleasure from it i had a client that turned to eating as her addiction  the advice i gave her applies to your situation as well  eating is something that we have to do and that an addict cannot cold turkey and walk away from  my client could not tell when she felt the urge to eat if it was because she was hungry or because she was upset about something and was subconsciously turning to food to make her feel better  her body was telling her brain that she needed to eat  i asked her to first stop and think when she felt the urge to eat  look at the clock and mark the time  tell herself that in one hour if she was still hungry then she could eat but that she needed to find something else to occupy her mind and her time until the hour had passed  she tried this for a weekshe said it worked  she would get busy reading a book watching tv or would go for a walk around her neighborhood for exercise and these activities would take her mind off things and the hour would pass and she wouldnt even notice the time  what this did for her was stop an unhealthy behavior and replace it with some healthier activities  she had to learn to first recognize when she was feeling the urge and then to come up with other activities to do instead you can do this with your urges  having sexual gratification as your one go to method to cope is causing you distress  make a list of other activities that you like and that you can engage in and when you feel the sexual urge make yourself do another activity for an hour to get your mind off of it  it may take a few tries to find an activity that will hold your attention  a habit that has developed over time is not going to be so easy to breakplease go to a medical doctor and get evaluated as well  they can do lab work and check your hormone levels  if needed medication can help  after being cleared medically counseling can help you  you stated that you have a disability that makes it impossible  a therapist can help you explore the feelings that you are experiencing due to the inability to have sex  this is a griefloss issue in the same way that someone who had lost the ability to walk might be grieving over his mobility  something that you used to be able to do now you cannot  it is expected that you might have some feelings of anger or sadness about this

to and most of us have to work at itcertainly at first im here to tell you
that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn unfortunately
the only way to do it is to do it what a paradox but there are plenty of

now and david richos when the past
is present richo asks that we dont beat ourselves up about dwelling on
past events this is natures way of reminding us that we have unfinished
business but while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits ushe offers three helpful steps to making any important life

want to be different awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffingstep two live as if you have
already made the change this is hard and takes courage but you can do it

practice practice practicejust as twoyearolds are able to walk
confidently after hundreds of hours of practice youll be able to stay in the
here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many many times"

2464,how can i become more understanding,,socialrelationships,i like your beautiful questionstart by understanding yourself and your own inner knowledge of who you are and what direction your life must take in order for you to feel comfortable and fulfilledunderstanding oneself is a life long activity even a necessity so that you are able to sense the truth of another personas long as you are taking steps in the direction of selfknowing you will gradually improve and increase the way and the range of understanding of other people and our worldgood luck with your project
2465,how can i become more understanding,,socialrelationships,man i love this goal we could all use a bit more of this sometimes i picture it like a salt shaker ill write an email then ill read it again from the receivers perspective and sprinkle a bit more understanding on it and i always like it better understandingcompassionempathythe world could use a lot more of these things and i love that you want to do your partwhat makes you want to be more understanding maybe you want to get closer to someone and resentment is in the way maybe you tend to get defensive and have trouble listening to and understanding someone whatever the reason lets get you started by having you write down those things in a list what things will be better in your life if you have more understanding get really grounded in why youre doing this then lets look at the barriers what do you risk if youre more understanding do you risk feeling vulnerable hurt attacked powerless feeling like youre losing in therapy you would get help looking at these questions what are you avoiding feeling once you have this answer then you can easily move to the next stepthe next step is working to tolerate that feeling youre avoiding tolerating it and leaning into it knowing that its only a feeling and not a realitythese thoughts can help you relax enough to take that wall down and allow space for other peoples truths not just yours once you know where you want to be with your thoughts it takes practise repetition to teach yourself new truths about how safe it is to allow yourself to be more understanding and let the wall come down its my guess that at some point in your life there was a reason for that wall of yours to be built sometimes we build walls as young people and then no one tells us how to take the wall down once we dont need it anymore we think we still need it i invite you to consider therapy as you explore these ideas i wish you the best
2466,i feel like my friends are ganging up on me,in this argument my friends are all against me so im wondering if im exaggerating my feelings i feel like im being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim when in reality im the one being unreasonable and i am simply annoying my reasonable friends or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship,socialrelationships,conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in every one of our relationships what im reading is that you find yourself in a loop of  seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself am i right if you arent validating yourself no one else will be able to either  try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing  and then if you are still feeling vulnerable share that too
2467,my friends accusing me of having problems,theyre calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as i do im tired of being called names what should i do,socialrelationships,it sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct communication is key to any relationship i would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded if after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly especially if this friendship is valuable to you however make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them on the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship not all friendships are healthy ones and it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder iti hope you are able to get this matter sorted best of luck
2468,the child i nanny hates me,"i nanny a three year old when he wakes up in the morning he calls out for someone to come get him if i am the one to go get him out of bed he gets really upset and refuses to let me near him he screams that he wants his mom or dad they work from home    the rest of the day he loves me but not in the mornings
   what can i do",childrenadolescents,it seems like you are being extra hard on yourself here  the behavior he exhibits is pretty normal for a three yearold  sounds like he may feel more emotionally dysregulated upon waking and wants one of his love sources to help him stabilize that  its probably more instinctual and not personal to yougive yourself some credit for how things are the rest of the daythats information that youve done well  you even describe that he loves you  thats hugeeither way im sure its jarring to go through that in the mornings  is there a routine you use to help him make that transition  i dont know what his parents rules are but there could be some ways to incorporate some predictable structure  maybe that means his favorite toystuffed animal paired with his favorite cartoon  you seem very caring so its probably likely you are already offering some compassionate response to his upset  it may help to have him take a couple deep breaths with you if hes able to help selfregulate  he may not be responsive to that and thats ok  either way it sounds like this is only happening upon wakinganother thoughtdo his parents know this is happening  maybe they have some ideas about how to help soothe him or perhaps they have some strategies they can use the night before eg talking to him about the emotions of the morning hours  let yourself off the hook thoughyou seem to be doing a wonderful job with this kiddo

   what can i do",childrenadolescents,it doesnt sound like he hates you just misses mom and dad in the mornings you could validate his feelings by saying something like i know you want to see mom and dad right now but they are working and then give him a couple options of things that may take his mind off of it this could be choosing what he has for breakfast or playing a game of his choice if possible it may also be helpful if you could create a routine in which he stops by mom and dad to say good morning if this is routine he will come to understand that he will be able to see mom and dad for a minute and not become anxious about seeing them

   what is wrong with me and how can i stop having these thoughts",diagnosis,those kinds of thoughts can be quite difficult to handle but if they are your own thoughts and not voices you are hearing which can be very different they likely are not new to you from what ive learned from clients i work with often these thoughts have been quite useful for them over the course of their lives that through criticizing oneself it is a way of motivating oneself however in your case and in most of those clients it has caught up to them and its almost like they no longer need the motivation that they can do just fine motivating themselves by themselvesi think its important to see these thoughts as the voice of the inner critic that inner critic was there for a long time again because it i like to identify it as a thing inside of you thought that you needed motivation in the form of criticism to stay on task with your life but now that that kind of sentiment is no longer needed by you it might be time to have a different kind of relationship with it but it wants to be heard it doesnt want to silenced or stopped in your words so instead of trying to ignore it perhaps we can see all the ways you are worth something and internalize take in let those ways resonate with you sit with them think about them so that the inner critic can see that it isnt quite correct in what it is saying in essence you are instead sitting with the thoughts or worthiness instead of worthlessnessif that is challenging sometimes seeing someone who is objective such as a therapist can be helpful they can help you see the ways in which you are strong have resilience as well as any positive attributes that might be hard to see in the face of this loud inner critic and above all if you feel like this doesnt resonate for you and that the voices might actually be voices an evaluation should be sought to further tease out what sorts of symptoms you are experiencing

important that a person feels that their therapist is right for them the
importance of this is not only because they will be asked to be
vulnerable and honest during sessions but also because it can impact treatment
outcomes having confidence in your therapist and the therapeutic relationship can
help foster success in therapygenerally speaking it is
a good fit if the therapist has expertise with your particular problem you connect
the feel or vibe of the therapist and you like their treatment
philosophy in order to find out if its a good fit you may have to directly
ask the therapist about their expertise and treatment philosophy many people
are arbitrarily matched to a therapist or believe that they have to see the
first therapist with an available appointment it is important to remember that
you have a choice in who your provider isas far as training your
therapist there are caveats here your therapist is responsible for providing
ethical and competent services without you having to train them such as maintaining
appropriate boundaries maintaining confidentiality etc assuming they are
meeting those minimum requirements the hope is that they are also
demonstrating respect for you such as starting session on time providing
consistency and being nonjudgmental if you do not feel respected or you
have concerns about their judgements i recommend you bring this to their
attention while the therapeutic relationship is unique and is not like other
relationships in our lives it is still a relationship it may be uncomfortable to tell them how
you feel about their behavior but there can be immense therapeutic value in these
conversations 
if your therapist is
providing ethical services competent services and demonstrating respect for
you its a good start if you are not getting the results you hope to get from
therapy it is still not your job to train the therapist but it would be
beneficial to bring this to their attention ask them about that goals and
objectives that you are working on and ask for clarity on the direction of
treatment these conversations can be incredibly beneficial to the therapeutic relationship
and the trajectory of treatment alternatively if you are not feeling good
about the provider their vibe the goals or the direction it may be time to seek
a consultation with another therapist starting over in therapy does require
quite a bit of emotional energy but that doesnt mean its not worth it"

2562,how would i know if i have the right therapist,"how do you know you have the right therapist for you
 how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment",counselingfundamentals,i think there are two major things that are necessary for a therapist to be helpful  the first is that you must feel comfortable with them  if you feel like the counselor was interested in your life and was caring during the first session thats a good sign  if not then run  trust your gut on this one  the second important thing is that you have to trust your counselor  your counselor can be kind but if they just sit there and nod without providing you anything its probably isnt a good fit  just like when you go to a medical doctor youre putting your care in their hands so you need to feel like there is expertiseif you not getting those things i would encourage you to voice your needs though i know that can be hard  if you counselor listens to that feedback its generally a good sign and if they dont it may be a sign that this isnt a good fit  the important thing is that you have to find a good fit  just like any other relationship not everyone is going to be a perfect match together

 how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment",counselingfundamentals,what an important question i think one of the first things to assess is this do you feel comfortable with your therapist do you feel like you can talk openly about whats going on in your life without feeling judged do you experience your therapy as a safe space to process your thoughts and feelings feeling comfortable with your therapist is a crucial factor once you feel comfortable with your therapist you can have a conversation about what works for you in therapy tell your therapist what is helpful and what you dont find helpful a skilled therapist can shift his or her style and techniques to meet your individual needs and this may be an ongoing conversation that the two of you have during therapy oftentimes there is just an x factor between client and therapist that either makes the relationship work or can make it feel like something is missing this is no ones fault its just that not every therapist will be a perfect match for every client if you feel uncomfortable with your therapist or feel like that x factor is missing it is a good idea to keep searching for therapist who is right for you
2603,how would i know if i have the right therapist,"how do you know you have the right therapist for you
 how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment",counselingfundamentals,this is a great question finding the right therapist can be tricky because you dont really know how someone will be like until you meet them a few ways to prescreen are to visit the therapists website psychologytoday profile social media etc have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentonce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations we are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you dont tell us we wont know dont be shy about what you like and what you dont like a good therapist will listen to your needs process them with you and create a customized plan that works for you and your life a good therapist will also not take anything you say even criticism personally coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go what makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics
2604,how would i know if i have the right therapist,"how do you know you have the right therapist for you
 how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment",counselingfundamentals,i believe that the right counsellor will help you feel empowered supported and understood you should feel comfortable opening up and not be concerned that they will judge you for what you say or decide to do i find this important to let my clients know during intake that they will never be judged for the decisions they decide to take while going over options in sessions together with me in terms of what you need from treatment please feel comfortable to open up to your therapist and tell them what you need from them for example do you prefer them to challenge you with questions listen to your story and ask questions throughout or near the end give you work to do outside of sessions the therapy sessions will work best for you if you can help them support you in what will work for youit can sometimes take a few trials of different therapists to find the right one so please do not give up if you feel disheartened you should feel proud of yourself for taking the first big step in asking for help that is not easy to do and you are on the right track already

2609,how would i know if i have the right therapist,"how do you know you have the right therapist for you
 how would i know how to train my therapist to be able to give me what i need from treatment",counselingfundamentals,the right therapist is a combination of expertise in the areas where you require and fit as far as how comfortable you feel in speaking and sharing with that person  people generally are quite good at determining whether or not someone fits well with their personality and style and another key to know whether therapy is working is to ask yourself  do i see that changes have come about since working with this therapist  do i feel better am i reaching goals that i set at the onset of therapy  are difficult situations becoming easier by how i handle them training a therapist really isnt necessary as all it requires is open and honest communication in order to give effective feedback that will in turn be helpful to you and your goals

2642,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,your therapy sessions and goals  are for you and about you they are not meant to be compared to anyone elses sessions and goals crying can occur in many different scenarios such as when youre happy relieved have just heard the funniest joke and of course when youre sad all of these feelings are valid and your tears are part of how your body experiences those feelings if youre often sad and working through a lot of sadness in your therapy sessions it is reasonable to expect that you may cry a lot during therapyif youre crying and you arent able to connect it to an emotional experience or feeling that is something to discuss with your therapist it can sometimes be difficult to name our feelings and the behaviors get ahead of our thinking brain to try and communicate for us maybe your tears are trying to tell you something about your feelings either way your therapy sessions should be a safe space for you to cry feel investigate and connect
2643,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,it is quite normal as conversations we have may touch on emotions thoughts and feelings that have been covered up for a long time just as laughter which may also be present in therapy joy sadness reflections these are all emotions and insights that can occur allowing yourself to feel and express yourself in a space of safety is freeing and enlightening not all sessions can have that but those moments are wonderful and continue on ones pattern of growth grab a kleenex and let it out
2644,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,not just you but everyone is different some people need to cry and others dont
2645,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,i cant tell you how many times ive heard people talk about terrible things that have happened to them yet they dont shed a tear  is that normal  well yes but not exactly healthy  its normal because theyve been conditioned this way  if you feel shame around crying then you most likely learned at some point in your life that its not okay to cry  most people have been told at some point in their life dont cry or dont be sad  but some people have had this message imprinted in their minds by negative experiences such as parent who shamed them or got mad at them for crying or simply by cultural or societal messagesthe truth is whether youre male female black white asian etc were all humans and crying is a natural response that allows our bodies to express ie release pain  it literally helps to get the emotional pain out  if you dont express your sadness in a healthy way writing or creating art to represent your emotions can be other healthy outlets then it will find another way to get your attention and that will likely not be healthy self harm inflicting harm on others numbingdissociating anxiety etcso to answer your question it is normal and healthy to cry in therapy  if you have no other place where you can allow yourself to cry with someone to witness and hold space for your pain then you are already benefitting from therapy  i would suggest exploring your beliefs around crying with your therapist if you feel ashamed of it  this is all too common but i believe that many people would start to feel better if they didnt judge themselves for crying or feeling sad  honor your pain and you will feel more at peace
2646,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,therapy is a safe place where we address a host of different issues many times things come up that we may have been too busy to address or we have become skilled in avoiding we usually avoid or push away painful experiences when we open ourselves to the healing process of therapy these painful things can be brought forward humans cry for many reasons commonly we cry when something touches us deeply and is related to a strong emotion of sadness hurt confusion happiness relief or some other emotion it would be natural for the body to respond to these emotions through crying as a side note we keep kleenex in every room of our office lobby and common areas httpwwwliferebirthedcom
2647,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,yes it is normal to cry in therapy when opening up and talking about uncomfortable feelings or experiences that a person has been holding onto there is a lot of emotion that is being released whether during a therapy session close friend or family memberwe all have painful memories and feelings talking about things brings up a lot and tears sometimes will follow if you cry during a session it just means that you have been holding onto difficult thoughtsfeelings that you finally are ready to look at and talk aboutin the beginning of working with a therapist lot of people feel uncomfortable when they cry often they will apologize for their tears question why they are crying now or try to dehumanize their feelings by labeling them  ie as silly stupid annoying there is no need to apologize or use labels as therapists know that with therapy comes healing sometimes healing needs tearslife at times is difficult and the stories behind ones emotions can be moving for both a client and therapist as a therapist i sometimes find myself wiping a few tears away too thats when you know someone is really listening to what you are sharing and understands the road youve walkedadrienne licari  httpwwwpositivetherapyservicescom
2648,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,emotion is the most normal and human activity that any person has the freedom to exercise  therapy is a place to explore freely the deepest most ignored and often denied concerns often time this process will evoke responses that were unexpected but perhaps needed what better place to begin exploring this than with a trained unbiased person crying speaks to the development of connection and is symbolic of acceptance and freedom of what was being held on to which may not have been beneficial
2649,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,are you crying because you are sad perhaps this is your heart breaking open ready to cope with your issues when we are sad and we dont cry maybe its because we are guarded and our ego is trying to protect us
2650,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,it for sure is it is a natural thing considering the act of therapy can be really cathartic and release emotions in a way that it makes sense to cry there is nothing wrong with it at all it is a healthy part of processing strong emotions
2651,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,it is absolutely normal to cry at therapy  it is common for a client to cry during a session  crying can be therapeutic especially for someone who is used to not allowing himherself to feel hisher feelings  i create a safe space in order for you to be able to share your tears as well as support you in understanding what your tears mean
2652,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,oh my absolutely it is i half jokingly tell my clients if i dont make you cry at least x during therapy i am not doing my job  i also let them know i am highly sensitive and may tear up with them but not to worry i cry at a good hallmark commercial  crying in therapy is not only normal it is healthy and expected i keep  tissue boxes in my office all within grabbing distance when you are in there a lot of times you are working on really heavy difficult stuff that maybe you have not shared before and that may stir up emotions and tears  people dont tell you how hard of work therapy is but it truly is hard work if you are doing it right  let the tears flow they are cleansing and can help you heal
2653,is it normal to cry at therapy,is it normal for people to cry during therapy or is it just me,counselingfundamentals,absolutely we talk about vulnerable things and crying is a human response i encourage my clients to cry and let out whatever they were holding in its not just you i cry with my therapist as well

2712,how does counseling help people,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,experts have defined counseling as a healing relationship that helps patients by providing a space to vent process and receive unconditional support  many of my clients have expressed that they are able to find their own answers during the session because they have the right person listening to them  some thought they were safe sharing their concerns with friends or relatives who are good listeners but later they felt ashamed or guilty about what they shared  so why people should share private issues with a counselor a stranger  confidentiality is the key word  a good counseling relationship should provide a space where people are able to share their deepest thoughts and feelings allowing themselves to be vulnerable and explore those emotions that are difficult to share without implications  beyond the ability to provide a safe place counselors are trained to identify symptoms and behavioral patterns and can provide insight on how develop coping mechanisms to improve their lifei am a license professional counselor working on a private practice in puerto rico latitude counseling and also im licensed in texas where i provide theletherapy services  if you would like to learn more about the services available you may call  or visit wwwlatitudecounselingcomcómo la consejería ayuda a las personasrealmente la consejería hace algo para ayudar a otrosexpertos definen la consejería como una relación sanadora que ayuda a los pacientes proveyéndoles un espacio para ventilar procesar y recibir apoyo incondicional  algunos de mis clientes han expresado que son capaces de encontrar las respuestas a sus problemas durante la sesión de consejería porque tiene a la persona indicada escuchándolos   otros cuentan que se sentian seguros compartiendo sus preocupaciones con su familia o amigos pero esas preocupaciones afectaron sus relaciones negativamente o los dejaron con sentimientos de culpa así que por qué deben las personas compartir asuntos privados con consejero un extraño  confidencialidad es la clave  una buena relación de consejería debe proveer un espacio donde las personas puedan compartir sus más íntimos pensamientos y sentimientos permitiéndoles ser vulnerables y explorar esas emociones que son difíciles de compartir sin consecuencias mas allá de proveer un espacio seguro lo consejeros profesionales estamos entrenados para identificar síntomas patrones de conducta y proveer perspectiva en cómo desarrollar los mecanismos de defensa necesarios para mejorar la calidad de vidasoy consejera profesional licenciada en puerto rico donde practico a través de latitdue counseling también estoy licenciada en texas donde proveo servicios de teleterapia  para más información llame al  o visite wwwlatitudecounselingcom
2713,how does counseling help people,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,i love this question some people shy away from counseling because they think since they already talk about how they feel to their relatives or friends they shouldnt need a counselor however if you are having a difficult time counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on track counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know for one your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do in that way counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation this gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings a counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions over time as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights the work you do is based on you and where you are at oftentimes when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you a counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your planbest of luck to you
2714,how does counseling help people,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,hello yes counseling can be beneficial to many people one of the effective components to effective therapy is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling i dont mean just show up and listen to the counselor for  minutes but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place this requires you to be vulnerable capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly honestly and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals  your improvement of self it does take time and there are no quick fixes usually so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places youll thank yourself later knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process be well
2715,how does counseling help people,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,"i believe that counseling and finding a good therapist
will be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change
improvement and overall growth most counseling involves homework and a level
of commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of
problems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way here are
some of the key ways that therapy can help 
 helps to define the problem and gain a clearer
understanding of where it originates many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are
experiencing these can include feeling sad increased sleeping substance use
panic attacks selfharm isolating ones self academic decline etc often
times people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms having a
therapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where
they come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their
problems 
 allows for a safe outlet to vent
not everyone likes to share their problems with close
friends or family members maybe they dont want others to know of their flaws
maybe they dont want to burden others with their problems or maybe they just
are not comfortable talking about themselves and in some situations people do
not have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no
friends or family while talking with those we know can help bring some relief
it is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and
emotionally removed from given situations counseling gives a safe outlet in
which one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling
judged
 counselors can offer various problem solving solutions

a good therapist usually will not directly point their
client in the direction they need to go counseling is about growth and
teaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies
that will bring about emotional and psychological relief counselors will help
clients to explore the various options available in given situation based on
the clients needs wants and values and will help them to choose the option
that best fits with their desired outcome 
 gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future
problems
many individuals that seek therapy have never learned
good coping strategies perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to
model productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are
overbearing and take away the energy needed to cope different diagnoses
require different tools however some are beneficial for any problem and any
individual these include but are not limited to relaxation techniques
breathing exercises development of healthy routines using mindfulness
improving communication skills and recognizing and changing maladaptive
thought patterns a good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools
will often practice them during session and will assign homework for further
practice and mastery of the skills"
2716,how does counseling help people,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,counseling allows us to have a sacred space a space that is set apart from the outside world it is a space of nonjudgement and exploration being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves it allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes our behaviors and our feelings imagine if you will a small goldfish swimming around the usual fish tank although i dont attest to know what a goldfish thinks i would imagine he does not see the world outside of him he only sees the small fishbowl oblivious to the outside world when one comes into the counseling room one is trying to gain insight that was not previously there remember the observer affect one cannot truly act objectively with the world we are in a dynamic relationship with life it reacts to us and we to it the time in the counseling room allows us to gain an understanding that is beyond the normal limits allowing us to see what was before hidden often times in plain sight

2718,how does counseling help people,does counseling really do anything that can help people,counselingfundamentals,a lot of things affect how helpful counseling is for each person including at least these things but often many othersthe therapeutic alliance this refers to the bond connection or trust between the client and the counselorwhat the person is coming in to work onhow motivated the person is to work on what it is they would like to changesome people also ask how counseling is different from friendship there is a similarity in the sense that hopefully both counselors and friends will listen to what you are experiencing but that is really the end of the similarities some differences arecounselors are specifically trained to phrase questions or statements in ways that help you to gain more awareness of one could be contributing to what it is that you are trying to change both within yourself and possibly with people around youcounselors have experience in using lots of different types of techniques for example focusing on finding solutions looking at how the present situation could relate to your past using roleplays or examples in session to help you learn new skills or ways of looking at situations and probably hundreds of other thingscounselors are taught to look at what you are experiencing and ask questions about other related ideas that you may not have connected to what you are experiencingthere is a treatment plan in place usually after the first second or third session so both you and the counselor have an idea of where you would like to go with counseling what you are hoping to change or learn and a general idea of a plan for getting to your goalsin general i would say the followingyes counseling can help people who want something to be different in their livescounseling is most helpful when the connection between the counselor and the client is strong enough that some trust forms in other words not every counselor or technique is helpful for every persona lot of counselors will talk to you on the phone for a few minutes prior to you coming in for your first appointment to answer any general questions that you may haveif you are working with a counselor and you feel as though you are not clicking or connecting with one another give it three or four sessions before you change trust is not happening in one hour for most of peopleif you are working with a counselor and you would like to be getting more or something different out of it tell the counselor about that because typically modalities can be changedif you are asking this question because you would like help with a specific issue call a local counselor and discuss it so that you could have a more specific answer about possible options for counseling

2720,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,hello there are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone  its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away you may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for youregardless of how you go about it i like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back there are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits you
2721,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,a great place to start is at wwwpsychologytodaycom  you can search by location and identify therapists who have expertise in your area of concern  once you find a few people that fit your criteria read about them on psychology today as well as check out their website if they have one  next either call or email them to set up a time to talk for a few minutes  when you speak with them you want to know a few things do they have a decent amount of experience in your area of concern  are their fees insurance coverage and scheduling availability a good fit for you  most importantly see if you feel comfortable when you speak to them on the phone  if this person is a good match in these areas schedule an initial consultation so that you can see if you are also a good match in person
2722,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,most counselors are very approachable and many offer a  minute chat by phone to allow you to talk about your issue and to get a feel for the counselor  if you like what you hear by phone the next step is to set up a facetoface meeting studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor  trust your instincts and if you dont feel comfortable let him or her know that you dont think its a good fit  many counselors list on websites like psychology today and good therapy  visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area

2724,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,hello counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help that said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near futurewhat they are able to pay for out of pocket that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesnt have to stay that way counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way the counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worthonce you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet that first session is often very low key there might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement this document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselors credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details all of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselorin the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous heres a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor its true we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us what makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like were standing on a three legged stool this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers we honestly do not plain and simple counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on lifes road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life so as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy

2733,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,first off i want to tell you how proud i am of you for starting out in the process it takes a lot of courage to seek out a therapist and perseverance to wade through all the logistics of the process just like finding a good doctor or dentist finding a therapist who is a good fit for you may take some time the difference being that you are likely to visit your doctor or dentist only a couple of times a year or in an emergency your therapist is someone you will be spending time with on a weekly or biweekly basis who you are going to be sharing a lot of yourself with so it is important to feel comfortable with that therapist even if sharing and reflecting is uncomfortable there are several places where a therapist may be searchable such as insurance directories websites or just a search engine so the first step is to see if they treat the kind of challenges you are dealing with or not if they dont list it as one of their skillsets they may not be able to support you and it may be unethical for them to work with you fear not that therapist may be able to provide you with the names of other providers who do specialize in your needs you can also try to filter through listings to see who focuses on your area of needs and then see how they talk about their therapeutic process do they position themselves as an expert and you a problem to be fixed is that what you want do you they talk about collaborating with you to identify problems and come up with solutions does that sound appealing to you there are a lot of different tools and techniques that therapists can rely upon but therapy at its foundation is about the relationship so if reading about them doesnt give you a good feeling move on to the next profileonce you have a few names that seem like a good fit reach out and see if they will meet with you briefly for a consultation these are usually free and give you an opportunity to see what it is like to interact with them how they answer questions and if their answers resonate with you you may find that it is awkward and that you are not at ease in the brief exchange but you may find that the rapport is already being established if none of the therapists you meet with work out or if you start meeting with a therapist and it doesnt feel right you can stop seeing them ask for a referral or start your search over again this process is about you and your needs not about pleasing the therapist so dont feel obligated to continue if it isnt working out

2736,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,great question  you can find a counselor by doing an internet search or by asking your doctor for a referral  once you have the name and contact information for a therapist you want to meet with give them a call  some therapists will provide a free  minute phone consultation  this is a good chance for you to get some questions asked  be sure to ask about their fee if you want to use your insurance ask them if they take your insurance  next you will want to ask about availability to make sure they have open times that fit in your schedule  once you make the appointment in the first session you have with the therapist the therapist will ask a lot of questions about what brought you into therapy and what you hope to accomplish in therapy  i usually use the last  minutes of that first session talking with clients about how i might be able to help them with their concern and i gather feedback from them  here is a link to an article about how to speak with your therapist in those first couple of sessions  httpthriveworkscomblogtipsopenhonestcounselor
2737,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,great question too often people search for the help they need via a phone book or a basic internet search when looking for a new person to add to your team whether it be a counselor plumber or mechanic it is important to know as much as you reasonably can about the person i generally take the following steps  know what is important to me in finding help  ask for referrals from my trusted friends family and colleagues  search for online reputation better business bureau yelp etc the absence of an online reputation is not necessarily a bar to consideration however a predominantly negative review may warrant further research  finally call the counselor and ask a few questions let the counselor know what you are looking for trust your gut for example if you feel rushed or do not receive thorough answer move on to the next taking the time to defining and conveying your requirements about what you are looking for in counseling can save you a lot of work down the road

2741,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,hello usually the person interested in therapy reaches out to the therapist by telephone or email  i like to respond with appreciation for their making contact and ask if they are available for a phone consultation in order to see how i may be able to help  once we are on the phone i like to get a brief sense of whats happening in their life and the way in which i respond and the way we communicate will give each of us a sense of whether our dynamic is appealing enough to take the next step  and the next step is making an appointment  also in the initial conversation you can feel free to ask what their therapeutic modality is or give a brief scenario and ask how the therapist might respond to that situation  i encourage you to be fearless in interviewing the therapist  this is one of the most sacred connections of trust you could be about to forge so if you dont feel comfortable move on to the next therapist on your list  if the connection feels good to you then its worth it to make the first appointment  you will immediately know if you dont feel comfortable speaking with this person  but if you do feel comfortable heard validated even in that short conversation i encourage you to make the appointment  once youre in the first session you can continue to assess through how your feeling and responding just how comfortable you are or are not just keep listening to yourself every step of the way

2746,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,the easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful there are lots of counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that check out their website social media and any reviews but remember people are not always very nice if you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services look for one that is in your network you can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurances website if your coverage isnt that great and you know youre going to be paying for it all anyway because youre an allstar and verified your coverage already with the insurance company then you can really pick any counselor you want but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible if you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once youve started counseling better is a good option once youve found a counselor you think is a good fit for you normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment with many counselors you can now send an email but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic once youre all scheduled they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there from there all you have to do is show up

2748,how does someone approach a counselor,how does a person start the counseling process,counselingfundamentals,i think it is important that you are able to convey what you are looking for in a therapist even if that changes over time  you need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need  to many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to reengage  remembering you are basically hiring someone to help you so i would treat it as such do some research and be clear as to why you are coming to therapy and ask questions as how they will be able to help you

2751,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,i think this question can vary based on the individual therapist their style and theoretical orientation clients are always welcome to ask questions before and during the process to understand their care when i am first meeting with a client i take a more formalized approach in our first session completing what is called a psychosocial assessment typically i explore what brought the client to therapy in the first place and i take a more direct approach asking a variety of questions related to the specific struggles frequency history duration etc this is not how my normal therapy sessions are and i try to explain that to my clients so they understand that while my first initial sessions is a lot of information gathering and me typing out their responses on going therapy is very client focused and catered to the needs of the client

2755,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,for me i want a client to feel like i understand what brings them to seek help from me so i might explore both their present circumstances as well as their history and try to start making some connections between the two but so that the both of us can understand what is taking place not every therapist goes into history in the same way either the way the therapist practices will often inform the ways in which they collect and look at datahowever above all my goal especially in the beginning of therapy is to work on developing a working rapport with any client most research states that the quality of the relationship rather than modality of therapy indicates success rates one of the most essential components of rapport is that someone feels heard attuned to and understood
2756,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,hi  this is an excellent question    i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist   in my work with people  once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the persona concerns and the issues they want help with  i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the clients current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress   i would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track  we would then discuss the best plan to address the clients concerns   usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful    i always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this  i tell them that i would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they wont try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me  i want to be helpful and while i have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies i really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and dont like  agree with or not agree with when i share my thoughts about a treatment plan   we the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful  but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along   if things arent improving  i am very happy and willing to try something new  i hope this is helpful for you 
2757,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,there are probably no two therapists alike because first and foremost we are human beingsandour personalities may somewhat guide how we go about getting to know you identifying what you would like to be different in your life and developing a plan to get where you would like to be the very most important thing that will determine a successful outcome is the healthy therapeutic relationship between you and your therapist  if you dont feel safe comfortable and ready to work together then it is likely not a good fit and thats okspeak up and the therapist should assist you in finding someone you can readily work with
2758,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,each counselor may have a different process so im not the end all authority here  for myself i review policies and confidentiality concerns with people first and answer any questions they have then ill let them know ill be writing a lot in this session and i have an assessment form that i like to get completed but i want to have a conversation and ill ask questions as we go  my first question is usually how do you feel i can best help you today  some people are very at ease and tell me many details  others are a bit more reserved and i have to demonstrate more curiosity  even people who have been very apprehensive are usually feeling very relaxed by the time the session is over  usually when we get close to end of session time ill summarize what i think are the biggest concerns from what ive heard and confirm whether or not the person wants to work on those things  i also try to give an exercise targetting my biggest concern for them to work on in between sessions  for instance a relaxation method if they are very anxious  counselors are just humans as well so it does take a bit of time to really get to know another person  i always tell people that are apprehensive to give the counselor  or  sessions to determine if they really connect with them  i hope that helps allison
2759,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,after meeting a client many counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor if you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us the better we understand what it is that bothers you what you would like to get out of the counseling and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals how the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling and that information is too much for this little post
2760,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,a good therapist will discuss what brought you to therapy in the first place and devise a therapy plan with you on some of the things that you may want to work on  the plan is not set in stone as things may arise during your therapy sessions you also agree on how often and when you would like to meet
2761,what happens in a counseling session,after first meeting the client what is the process that a counselor facilitates,counselingfundamentals,great question which i imagine many other people have as wellthe therapist will want to know your main source of life discomfort  in what areas are the problem interactions which you hope will disappearthe therapist is trained to listen for your emotions to your story  and to open these up to you in a kind and safe way so that youll start to see your circumstance in a new light in which you feel more of your own authority to handle the troubling conditionsthe therapist and you will refine your thinking and theories   the therapist will ask questions to help you prepare for any stumbling blocks along your way of creating your own new answers to the problem you brought to counselingi hope youll enjoy learning and creating new thinking and interacting patterns
2762,what are the skills needed by a counselor,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals,some basic skills are empathy you should feel heard and understood the therapist should keep the focus on you since counseling is about you and the issues your facing that being said if you feel like they are sharing too much its going okay to say this they should also be able to identify some coping skills to help you manage the symptoms your experiencing
2763,what are the skills needed by a counselor,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals,many skills and education and years of it plus experience  and many have done or went through their own and can relate  a lot of times many are just not happy with counselors with just the traditional type of education and want someone who can relate or even inspire to self grow    they need to be creative and very authentic  to understand that it is not about the client thinking the counselor is going to solve their problems it is about separating and helping guide them to their goals as a result in what makes them a full filled individual  plus as a counselor we continue to expand our skills and we also have our own masters so that we can be better for our practice
2764,what are the skills needed by a counselor,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals,counselors are actually required to have many skills before walking into the fieldwe need to know a lot about all disorders as well as techniques that best compliment them however that may look different depending on who we are sitting with  that skill is the ability to integrate assessments over the span of counseling to best fit the clients needs  humans are complex so its important to stay flexiblebecause the clientcounselor relationship is the best predictor of therapy outcomes skills here are crucial  counselors need to really be authentic which includes sharing empathetic responses with the client  i have met a few clients that worry that those skills are feigned because its our job but these responses are very real  we care about our clients and want to express that to thema skill that we use often all through counseling but especially in the beginning is conceptualization  very important because it not only helps in understanding our clients perspective but helps to get a picture of the different pieces of why someone is functioning the way they are  yes humans are complex but we become pretty simple when you work out all the parts  for example if your pattern is to yell in arguments a way to conceptualize that is that the trigger is the argument your body goes into fight mode you feel adrenaline and anger you then yell to reduce anger  that reduction you feel in anger reinforces yelling and if it made you feel better in the moment thats a reward even if you feel guilty later on  every behavior can be conceptualized and helps both the counselor and client understand all the elements of functioning and helps guide the focussome counselors specialize in areas or have a niche  that doesnt make a counselor better than any other counselor but could make them a better fit for you  knowing what you need out of a counselor is most important
2765,what are the skills needed by a counselor,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals, an awareness of their own incompetence and inexperience with events in your life an awareness of how the body mind emotions spirit and others all intertwine and activate one another how to work to use these connections to have you improve your experienceoh yeah and theres some listening in there as well 
2766,what are the skills needed by a counselor,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals,here is a list of skills i use every session and a short explanation of what they arereflecting paraphrasing what clients have said so that they know you understand themvalidating helping clients to know that their point of view is valuable and rationalclientcentered talk maintaining focus on the client in therapy sessions rather than a therapist talking about themselvesattending nonverbal or verbal cues that indicate i am listening to a client ie nodding leaning in affirmationsreframing helping a client to see a problematic behavior or situation in a different way usually only works well after they feel heard and understood
2767,what are the skills needed by a counselor,what are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have,counselingfundamentals,i think that the most important skill a good counselor has is the ability to empathize whether that be natural empathy or trained empathy is essential a good counselor also knows the difference between identifying with their client and empathizing with their client an ability to not bring in our own baggage we all have baggage and most are wounded healers into our work as its not about us if it is brought in it should be in only a way that can help a clientand to listenspecifically to what the client is needing

2769,are some clients more difficult than others,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,each client brings their own style they like to a coaching or counseling relationship  when i counseled and coached military i learned to relate to what style of coaching they seek  some were better at the drill sergeant style of coaching  or a liberal style integrative humanistic progressive or conservative  some can be obsessed and try and cross the line  when you are in the public eye it can be a bit much and you have to know what client is a good fit for your practice  some dont see you as human but we are  we seek to do the best we can with our knowledge cause it is a calling and i am sure others will say on here that we have to have our go to place of healing also so we can be good for our clients
2770,are some clients more difficult than others,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,although many clients have the capacity to be engaged in the therapeutic process and express their thoughts and feelings in an articulate way others may demonstrate resistance to treatment which can manifest in ways such as reflecting the desire to end therapy prematurely cancelling appointments or arriving late a resistant client can also make the process of the therapist engaging the client challengingonce the therapist identifies the resistance it is essential for the  therapist to address it with the the client and encourage the client to focus on the therapeutic goalsin my experience i have observed that people have many reasons why they begin to show resistance some may believe the therapist is judgmental and they may not for one reason or another feel  emotionally safe with the therapist others may not feel comfortable talking about their feelings and it may appear that they never developed a rapport with the therapistsometimes a person may harbor feelings of distrust or dislike for the therapist which eventually creates barriers to good treatment outcomes
2771,are some clients more difficult than others,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,i usually dont label a client as difficult because whatever they are presenting with makes sense for how they believe they need to live  difficult is also so subjective so it could mean something different for each personit can be really hard for most counselors to feel stuck with a client  sometimes both the counselor and client have blind spots where we arent aware of how functioning is surviving or were unsure of how to move forward despite many attempts to do so  some clients are also ambivalent to change even though they show up to counseling  most of my client load is comprised of teens that are mandated to be in therapy or day treatment and at times its a struggle to build a relationship as a result  it takes take to work through that and a patient understanding counselor will know to allow the client to meet at their own pacei think its common for counselors to sometimes perceive something as more difficult than it really is  ive definitely been guilty of that  all some clients need is just someone who will listen understand and extend empathy  we can fall into expectations of our clients growth that may not even be needed or realisticno matter what a client comes into session with they should never be blamed for their issues or made to feel like they are themselves difficult  therapy is hard and when you see a counselor its usually because you are having difficulties that feel unsolvable on your own
2772,are some clients more difficult than others,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,dang right  heh heh and correct me if im wrong and if we are truly professionals we should be able to handle even the most bumptious of folks now shouldnt we its like a mechanic who knows his way around every inch of an engine hell know what to do heh heh heh
2773,are some clients more difficult than others,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,yes just like some relationships outside of our work are more difficult than others but i would not say that the client is more difficult rather the dynamic between myself and the client which constitutes a relationship might feel more difficult and thats okay sometimes things that feel like the most challenging end up with profound shifts and outcomes it is often helpful to understand difficulties that exist because they can illuminate for a therapist something with which a client might be struggling and when it takes place in the therapy space it can be experienced and then worked throughits hard to necessarily say what some difficulties are that a counselor might encounter but i would say that not showing up like in any relationship is one of the hardest things for me and not just physically not showing up though that is certainly frustrating but not being open to the work is a form of not showing up while not every client is as motivated to change its helpful to my therapistclient relationships that the client try it might be hard for them but the effort even to say this is tough for me can go a long way in these kinds of relationships
2774,are some clients more difficult than others,what are some difficulties that a counselor can encounter when dealing with a client,counselingfundamentals,each counselor will have their own list of difficulties in doing therapy work with a client  even if clinically trained similarly since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humanson my list is when the emotional pain i feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another feels very deepsometimes i feel like avoiding the pain i feel by asking questions which will steer the conversation away from the painful areas the client talks aboutwhat in fact is necessary to clear out their pain is to step further into so as to realize their emotional pain isnt greater than who they are
